This is partially due to its unique approach to education, which stresses the importance of independent study.
Princeton’s undergraduate academics grant bachelor’s degrees in the arts and sciences. In their third and fourth years, all undergraduates must pursue independent research in their chosen field of study. Depending on your major and academic goals, this can vary from a lab research to a creative project.
The graduate school at Princeton University offers a variety of master’s degrees and Ph.D.’s, as well as continuing education programs to suit diverse academic needs. The graduate school does not use a credit-based system, and your department and advisor will determine your curriculum.
Tuition at Princeton is among the most expensive in the country. In light of this, the university aims to support its students with significant financial assistance.

The schools of the university include School of Architecture, College of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Law, School of Medicine, McIntire School of Commerce, Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, and School of Nursing.
The university offers 51 bachelor's degrees in 47 fields, 84 master's degrees in 67 fields, 6 educational specialist degrees, two first-professional degrees (law and medicine), and 57 doctoral degrees in 55 fields. Affiliated with 7 Nobel laureates, it has produced 5 NASA astronauts, 7 Marshall scholars, 4 Churchill scholars, 29 Truman scholars, and 50 Rhodes scholars.
Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819. He wished the publicly-supported school to have a national character and stature. It is the first non-sectarian university in the United States and the first to use the elective course system.
Jefferson considered the founding of the university to be one of his greatest achievements. Undertaking the project toward the end of his life after a long and illustrious career that included serving as a colonial revolutionary, political leader, writer, architect, inventor, and horticulturalist, he was closely involved in the university's design. He planned the curriculum, recruited the first faculty, and designed the Academical Village, a terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, gardens, and the majestic center-point, the Rotunda. The most recognizable symbol of the university, the Rotunda stands at the north end of the Lawn and is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda have served as models for similar designs of centralized green areas at universities across the United States.
The university was opened for classes in 1825 with a faculty of eight and a student body numbering sixty-eight. Jefferson took great pains to recruit the most highly qualified faculty, five of whom were found in England and three in the United States. Instructions were offered in ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, chemistry, law, and medicine.
Jefferson opposed the granting of degrees on the grounds that they were ‘artificial embellishments’. In 1824, however, the Board of Visitors authorized granting the Master of Arts degree. The Doctor of Medicine or M.D. was awarded to the first graduates of the School of Medicine in 1828 and the Bachelor of Law degree or LL.B. was first awarded for law school graduates in 1842. The bachelor's degree was awarded beginning in 1849, but became the standard undergraduate degree and a prerequisite for the master's degree in 1899 bringing the university into conformity with other institutions of higher learning. The PhD has been awarded since 1883.",,,,,,10001+,,806,"Education, Software",1,Thomas Jefferson,,4,,2019-05-24,"$68,000,000.0",Grant,,,,"$217,000,000.0",Chris and Carrie Shumway Foundation,1,1,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,2021-01-29,2,"28,260",,-0.2,1.4,1.3,64,"Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Management, Marketing, Medical &amp; Science, Operations, Pro Services, Product, Sales","2,746","4,714,932","5,195,582",5.54%,720,13.21%,4.36,15.82%,49.25%,-4.59%,"32,280","1,625",5.3%,20,2,,,1,0,Casting; Powder Metallurgy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1,925",,,

- Try-and-hire model, providing a pool of candidates &nbsp;to try on the job before finalising roles
We don’t do half-baked solutions, quick fixes or shortcuts. Our curriculum is designed so students become well-versed in mainstream programming languages such as Python, Java and Javascript, while gaining sound knowledge of GIT, various databases and agile software development methods like SCRUM. Heading towards mastery-based learning methods, students can progress at their own pace, only moving on to the next stage once they know everything at their current level.
We know how much soft skills matter in the workplace, be it a buzzing start-up or a high-profile tech giant. That’s why our English-language curriculum is practice-based from day one. Students in their training are working on real-life team projects in the classroom and perfecting their skills through self-instructed assignments at home. Our mentors act as learning facilitators or guiding sherpas as we like to think of them, rather than traditional disseminators of knowledge. We make sure that students learn all the ropes needed in the workplace, from working well in a team to managing their time and solving whatever problem comes their way.&nbsp;

We serve working parents, underserved communities, military members and first-generation college students with flexible degree plans that fit with their busy lives. 
 
University of Phoenix is designed specifically for adult learners. Unlike typical college students aged 18 - 22, adult learners often have to balance family life and careers alongside their education. The rigid schedules and in-person requirements of traditional universities mean many adult learners spend up to 10 years pursuing their degree. 
 
That’s why Dr. John Sperling founded University of Phoenix in 1976. Dr. Sperling grew up poor and struggled with a learning disability, seeing firsthand what it was like to struggle in an educational system that did not meet his needs. In response, he established the University to make higher education available to adults who wanted to learn real-world knowledge on their chosen terms. 
 
Since our founding, we have done just that. University of Phoenix gives students access to quality education paired with support and resources well after graduation. 
 
With dedication to innovation, University of Phoenix has transformed the higher education experience with virtual learning programs. We have offered online degrees since 1989, scheduling classes on a 24/7 basis so students can learn at any time and from any place.
 
University of Phoenix is accredited by the [Higher Learning Commission] (http://hlcommission.org). We offer certificates as well as associate, bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees programs with over 100 options mapped to over 300 potential career paths. As of 2020, University of Phoenix has celebrated 1,052,599 student alumni from over 80 countries. 
 
The benefits of the University extend far beyond our flexible coursework. We are here to give our graduates the ongoing support they need to pursue opportunities in their chosen careers: 
- Career Services for Life® commitment provides one-on-one career coaching and workshops to all University of Phoenix students and graduates. 
- Over 50 alumni chapters and the PhoenixLink Network connect graduates with potential job opportunities. 
- Students have 24/7 remote access to our digital library, which has thousands of eBooks and journals available on demand. 
- Students can also access self-guided or vendor-provided tutoring for math or writing through a dedicated tutoring portal. 
- University of Phoenix offers partial tuition scholarships to eligible students. The complimentary iGrad® service helps teach students how to budget, save and borrow money responsibly. We also offer the iLife Resource Center to connect students with counseling and life coaching options for housing, time management, and more.
 
Since 1976, University of Phoenix has granted over 1.2 million degrees and certificates. Learning is far from easy, but the University aims to make learning more practical for working adults. Many of our students are nontraditional who are driven to meet their academic and professional goals. University of Phoenix has supported students for decades, striving to make it as accessible as possible for working adults to unlock their future with flexible degree paths.",,,,Private,Four Year University,10001+,Online and On Campus,302,"Education, Other, Science and Engineering, Software",1,John Sperling,5001-10000,3,,2020-04-06,"$127,132.0",Venture - Series Unknown,"$127,132.0",Venture - Series Unknown,"$512,132.0","$25,512,132.0",,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,1,"37,115",,1.2,-0.2,-0.2,16,"Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Management, Marketing, Medical &amp; Science, Operations, Pro Services, Product, Sales, Support","3,219","4,839,604","4,269,065.5",16.64%,522,-16.61%,5.34,-20.53%,28.71%,22.27%,"31,585","-1,033",-3.17%,73,,,,36,50,Computing; Calculating,Education; entertainment,,,,,,,,,,,,,945,,,

pioneering research with students and with local businesses and
organizations as well. Research areas include such fields as Biological
Sciences, Biomedical Studies, Nanotechnologies and Wireless
Communications.
Opportunities for work abound for NJIT grads in great part because of the
quality of student training and the reputation of the school. Also
important are the internships, which the school arranges for students
while they’re still studying.
Classrooms and research centers aren’t the only place on the NJIT campus

recreation areas, computer labs, and restaurants add to the contemporary
look and feel of the NJIT experience.

employment opportunities available in the area. With its restaurants and
cultural activities, Newark also provides much in the way of recreation
and culture. New York City is also only 20 minutes away, so there is even

Claremont McKenna College (CMC) educates its students for thoughtful and productive lives and responsible leadership in economics, government and public affairs. CMC's strong grounding in the liberal arts, together with its emphasis on economics, government, and international relations, attracts students who approach education pragmatically and who intend to make a difference in the world. With this broad-based foundation graduates leave CMC well prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. Many go on to pursue careers in law, business, government, foreign service, international relations, public policy, museum administration, science and education, or to pursue graduate study.
The College's cutting-edge research institutes provide students unprecedented opportunities to work alongside their professors and discover how what they learn in the classroom links to life in the world beyond. The world comes to Claremont McKenna through a vibrant and renowned speakers series in which world leaders, thinkers, artists and visionaries visit campus through the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum and other public programming.

Strathmore University is a leading not for profit private University operating in Kenya, which aims at serving the Kenyan society to the best of its ability. Specialising in Commerce and Information Technology, Strathmore holds a peerless reputation for quality in both academic and professional education and personal information. 
Strathmore College was started in 1961 as an Advanced-level Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects by a group of professionals, who formed a charitable Educational Trust (now the Strathmore Educational Trust). Saint Josemaría Escrivá, founder of Opus Dei, inspired and encouraged them to start the College. 
In March 1966, the first intake of Accountancy students, twenty-five in number, joined the Sixth Form students, and began preparing for the examinations of the UK-based Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). These first Accountancy students were sponsored by Shell East Africa, BAT (East Africa) and the East African Breweries. At this time Strathmore College was unique as a fully integrated post-Form 4 institution offering both academic and professional courses. 
In October 1982, owing to the increased demand from companies for the professional training of their employees, the College began evening courses in Accountancy after normal working hours, with 60 students sponsored by various companies. 
In 1986, in response to a request by the Trustees, the Government of Kenya donated 5 acres of land on Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate. The European Union (EU) and the Italian Government agreed to back the Madaraka Campus project. The donors were keen to support a co-educational College that would offer courses in Management and Accountancy. Kianda College, an undertaking of Kianda Foundation, which was planning new developments at the time, agreed to run their professional courses in the new Madaraka campus. 
Construction of the new campus commenced in September 1989. Meanwhile, in January 1991, the Information Technology Centre was started in the Lavington Campus to run computer courses leading to the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (formerly Institute of Data Processing Management) Diploma and Higher Diploma. In January 1992 a Distance Learning Centre was opened to offer correspondence courses in Accountancy to students who are unable to attend lectures. 
In January 1993 Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate.",,,,,,,,24,"Education, Other",,,,1,,2022-08-23,"$50,000.0",Grant,,,,"$50,000.0",Mozilla’s Common Voice,1,1,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,"49,964",,-0.1,8.2,8.1,1,"Engineering, Finance, Legal, Management, Operations, Sales",37,"69,251","313,730.33",-42.26%,767,8.79%,5.24,-0.75%,32.55%,5.92%,"677,605","235,973",53.43%,199,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37,,,

Attracting top students from across the nation and more than 100 countries around the world, OU provides a major university experience in a private college atmosphere. OU is number one in the nation in the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled among public universities and is in the top ten of public universities in the nation in the graduation of Rhodes Scholars. The OU Honors College is one of the largest honors programs among public universities in the United States, matching the University’s best and brightest students with faculty in classrooms of 19 or fewer students. OU is one of the few public universities in the nation to cap the class size of first-year English composition courses at no more than 19. OU offers students the opportunity to study abroad in over 100 cities and 50 countries, including our signature program in Arezzo, Italy. The number of endowed faculty professorships and chaired positions has increased from less than 100 15 years ago to more than 560 today. This enables OU to keep and attract faculty researchers of national and international stature. 
 
For four of the last six years the OU Debate team has won the National Debate Championship. Other students from across campus have worked in teams to also win top awards in the National Petroleum Engineering Competition, the National Kennedy Center Competition in Drama, and the entrepreneurship program consistently ranks in the top five nationally.
 
OU has emerged as a pacesetter for public higher education in the United States and is ranked by The Princeton Review among the top 10 public universities in the nation in terms of academic excellence and cost for students. OU has more than doubled the amount of private scholarships in five years and raised its scholarship goal to $250 million. In addition, OU’s private endowment has increased more than five-fold since 1994, growing from $204 million to more than $1.8 billion. 
 
There is a true sense of family on the OU campus. Serving as a model for other public universities, OU established the Faculty-In-Residence program which places faculty members and their families in each of our residence halls to foster faculty and student interaction and encourage intergenerational friendships. Further, a different professor adopts each floor of the residence halls as well as each fraternity and sorority, allowing students and faculty to build relationships outside of the classroom. 
 
OU’s Fred Jones Museum of Art ranks in the top 5 university art museums in the United States. It received the Weitzenhoffer Collection, the largest gift of French Impressionist art ever given to a public university in the US. The Sam Noble Museum of Natural History is the largest university based museum of its kind in the world.

messages of Vincennes University. Located in the small town of Vincenne,
Indiana, Vincennes is a university wrapped within a small college,
wrapped within a university.
Since you get the best of both a small college and large university
experience, Vincennes is ideal for those who are looking for an intimate
and personalized environment in which to pursue a one, two or four-year
degree.
Vincennes University admissions require a high school diploma or GED. If
you do not have either, contact the admissions office for your options.
Academics include over 200 majors offered at Vincennes University in
health, sciences, humanities, performing arts and business among others.
However, Vincennes University's classes remain small, with an average
student-faculty ratio of 15:1.
Not only are the classrooms intimate, but college life promises a
personal experience as well. For example, all students under age 21 are
required to live in one of the six residence halls. Each of the halls
features computer labs, kitchens and recreation rooms, promising a
socially warm community at ""home"" as well as in the classroom.
Over 40 student clubs and a cluster of sororities and fraternities
enhance the personalized social experience while helping to develop
leadership and other skills.
While small, Vincennes is sure to point out that it certainly isn't
lacking in quality, academically or culturally. The Red Skelton
Performing Arts Center, a recently-built structure that hosts plays and
concerts, is one example of how Vincennes continues to expand. The Donald
G. Bell Recreational Facility is another recent addition to the campus.
Students may also benefit from participating in one of Vincennes'
internship, work-study or volunteer opportunities with a variety of local
businesses or charitable organizations.
In addition to work-study to assist with tuition, there are loans and
partial or full scholarships for home-schooled high school students.
There are also scholarships based on academic merit. These and other
forms of financial aid are available to those who qualify.",,,,,,11-50,,6,,2,"Kevin Hills, William Henry Harrison",1-10,3,,2022-07-07,"$2,250,000.0",Grant,,,,"$10,350,000.0","U.S. Department of Education, Lilly Endowment, Caterpillar Foundation",3,3,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,"62,885",,0.5,-0.3,2.6,,Management,6,"200,673","104,215.83",135.64%,721,65.75%,9.87,76.77%,32.59%,-29.12%,"330,292","-225,166",-40.54%,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,

Until Clark instituted undergraduate programs in 1902, the University offered only Ph.D.-granting programs. Clark is also one of the oldest universities in the United States to offer formal graduate programs, second only to Johns Hopkins University. 
Clark University’s mission is to educate undergraduate and graduate students to be imaginative and contributing citizens of the world, and to advance the frontiers of knowledge and understanding through rigorous scholarship and creative effort. 
The University seeks to prepare students to meet the challenges of a complex and rapidly changing society. In students and faculty, Clark fosters a commitment to excellence in studying traditional academic disciplines, as well as innovation in exploring questions that cross disciplinary boundaries. The free pursuit of inquiry and the free exchange of ideas are central to that commitment. 
The focus of Clark's academic program is a liberal-arts education enriched by interactions among undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty, and is closely linked to a select number of professional programs. Clark also serves students who wish to continue formal education throughout their lives. 
The intellectual and personal growth of students is enhanced by a wide variety of educational programs and extracurricular activities. Clark believes that intellectual growth must be accompanied by the development of values, the cultivation of responsible independence, and the appreciation of a range of perspectives. 
Clark's academic community has long been distinguished by the pursuit of scientific inquiry and humanistic studies, enlivened by a concern for significant social issues. Among many other scholarly endeavors, Clark contributes to understanding human development, assessing relationships between people and the environment, and managing risk in a technological society. 
Clark is dedicated to being a dynamic community of learners able to thrive in today’s increasingly interrelated societies. The University maintains a national and international character, attracting high-caliber students and faculty from all quarters of the globe. As a university residing in an urban context, Clark also strives to address the needs and opportunities of contemporary urban life. 
Clark's intimate academic setting and tradition of ""elbow teaching"" provide many opportunities for students to pursue knowledge through participation. High expectations, as well as easy access to the scholar-teacher faculty, encourage students to become autonomous learners. 
Clark's international and interdisciplinary orientation is combined with a tradition of strong self-direction among students and faculty. These attributes enhance the University's ability to contribute to the development of new modes of thought and to the advancement of society through the creation and transmission of knowledge.",,,,Private (Non-Profit),,,,76,"Education, Other",1,Jonas Gilman Clark,1-10,1,,2022-07-20,"$2,000,000.0",Grant,,,,"$2,000,000.0",AmeriCorps Public Allies,1,1,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,2021-09-07,,,"64,396",,-0.5,-1.0,8.5,1,"Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Management, Marketing, Medical &amp; Science, Operations, Pro Services, Sales",901,"977,842","587,810.67",225.64%,976,60.53%,3.9,-6.22%,50.76%,-1.26%,"107,813","-129,052",-54.48%,98,,,,1,2,Agriculture; Forestry; Animal Husbandry; Hunting; Trapping; Fishing,Education; entertainment,,,,,,,,,,,,,176,,,

The university is the major institution of higher education in a region larger than 46 of the nation’s 50 states and is the only campus in Texas that is home to a major university, law school and medical school. 
Originally named Texas Technological College, the college opened in 1925 with six buildings and an enrollment of 914. Graduate instruction did not begin until 1927 within the school of Liberal Arts. A “Division of Graduate Studies” was established in 1935 and eventually became known as the Graduate School in 1954. 
By action of the Texas State Legislature, Texas Technological College formally became Texas Tech University on September 1, 1969. 
A new era of excellence is dawning at Texas Tech University as it stands on the cusp of being one of the nation's premier research institutions. 
Research and enrollment numbers are at record levels. Texas Tech's total research expenditures topped $140 million in 2012. Fall enrollment for 2013 eclipsed that of the previous fall with 33,111 students. Numbers like that cement Texas Tech's commitment to attracting and retaining quality students. The university strives to foster an environment that celebrates student accomplishment above all else. Texas Tech is large enough to provide the best in facilities and academics, but small enough to focus on each student individually. 
Quality students need a top-notch faculty. Texas Tech is home to a diverse, highly revered pool of educators who excel in teaching, research and service. In 2013, ten faculty members were awarded grants from the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program, the most of any research university in the nation. Through the Fulbright program, educators are bestowed the opportunity to work side-by-side with researchers around the world promoting educational collaboration.

50 research centers and institutes make their home at UT Dallas and conduct world-renowned research in such disciplines as Space Science, Bioengineering, Cybersecurity and Nanotechnology.
While it is known as a research institution, UT Dallas’ MBA and Engineering programs have received top rankings by numerous academic, scientific and business-related publications. 
Given all this, it’s no wonder that high-performing students from all over Texas and from various other states and even countries flock to UT Dallas. Designated as having a “more selective” admissions policy by U.S. News, UT Dallas generally admits students whose SAT scores are above 1200. 
UT also excels in its extracurricular offerings. UT Dallas is home to a Division III athletics program and number of intercollegiate teams. They also have more than 160 student organizations, including a nationally-recognized debate team.
But even with all that prestige, UT Dallas students do not need to feel overwhelmed. The school is large enough to be dynamic, but small enough to still allow for personal, one-on-one interaction among students and between students and faculty. Career, academic and personal counseling are all accessible student resources.
In addition to offering standard financial aid packages to eligible students consisting of loans, grants, work-study and fellowships, UT Dallas has the “tuition promise” plan.

Technology, Cosmetology, Film, International Studies, Medical Coding and
Pyro-Technology, among many others.
Student life is also varied. At its Grand Theatre, SLCC features
performances of popular and classic plays with local professional actors.
There is also a film festival, a lecture series, a student-run radio
station and newspaper, and a number of student clubs and organizations.
Student services also provide the full range of academic, career planning
and personal resources.
However, while Salt Lake’s campus may abound with options, students are
given the same amount of individual attention found at a small, private
school. With a low faculty to student ratiom classes are kept small and
professors numerous and accessible enough to meet privately with students
as well.
While many students use their Salt Lake degree to forge a new career, a
large number also transfer to such schools as Brigham Young University.
Since tuition at Salt Lake is significantly lower than that of a
university, attending Salt Lake for the first two years of their
bachelor’s lowers student’s expenses by a lot.

Ball State is ranked a research university, high research activity by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Individual programs are accredited by various regional and national organizations. 
At Ball State, they're more than just educators—they're educational entrepreneurs. Combining top-flight talent with the top-notch resources they have to offer, theirr students and faculty inject endless energy and creativity into what they teach and how they learn. The result—a university The Princeton Review calls one of the best in the Midwest. 
To fulfill Ball State's mission of fundamentally changing their students, researchers and external partners, they offer comprehensive academic opportunities, including about 180 undergraduate majors and preprofessional programs and more than 100 master's and doctoral degrees. Ball State's programs in architecture, telecommunications, landscape architecture, education, entrepreneurship and online master’s degree in nursing are consistently ranked among the best in the nation. That excellence is only possible because of the quality of Ball State's faculty and their commitment to teaching. More than 90 percent of Ball State's classes are taught by professors. That's almost unheard of at an institution of Ball State's size. 
Ball State believes that for an educational experience to be successful, it should be just that—an experience. So Ball State has made a unique commitment to immersive learning programs that incorporate research, projects with community partners and capstone experiences into the curriculum. Acting, musical theatre, and telecommunications students participate in talent showcases in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Students in Ball State's entrepreneurship program face the ultimate pass or fail test—to graduate, they must pitch a business plan that a panel of experts deems viable. 
Ball State enrolls about 21,000 students, with more than 17,800 attending on campus. Students come from 48 states, two U.S. territories, about 43 countries, and every Indiana county.

UC Riverside, which was ranked in the top tier of national universities by U.S. News and World Report, offers a total of over 170 bachelors, master’s and doctoral degrees in subject areas encompassing the arts, humanities, social science, engineering, natural sciences, business and education among others. 
UCR also always continues to add new programs. For example, the MFA in Creative Writing and Writing for Performance, one of the only inter-genre writing programs in the country, was implemented several years ago. 
UC Riverside also offers rich extracurricular activities. There is KUCR, the student-run radio station, numerous performing arts opportunities as well as many community service and academic and other types of organizations. 
However, while UCR offers a rich and lively atmosphere, students can expect to receive extensive one-on-one attention from accessible professors in mostly small classes.

As the first public law school in Southern California and the youngest top-ranked law school in the United States, UCLA Law has consistently pushed new boundaries in the study and practice of law.
Beginning in the 1970s, our clinics were among the first to teach students systematically about the link between doctrinal mastery and practical skills. We remain committed to this integration of theory and practice with an extraordinary array of simulated transaction courses and live-client clinics that cover everything from mergers and acquisitions to workers’ rights and environmental law.
In the 1990s, UCLA Law created an Empirical Research Group (ERG) so that faculty could incorporate sophisticated data techniques into their research. During this time, the law school also established think tanks where policy and legal issues could be discussed free of partisan influence and ideological biases. These institutes have consistently promoted the highest standards of intellectual discourse. Through research and published articles, our centers offer invaluable information for legislators, the judiciary and the public while providing critical training for UCLA Law students and the legal community. 
Over the decades, UCLA Law has developed a depth and breadth of academic offerings unsurpassed by any other law school in the nation. Our Epstein Program in Public Interest Law and Policy is among the best anywhere. We are one of four among the top 20 law schools with a specialization in Business Law and Policy – and the only one to offer a specialization in Critical Race Studies. 
UCLA Law’s faculty also has emerged as one of the most influential nationwide. Our professors are leading scholars in areas including bankruptcy, corporate law, constitutional law, critical race theory, entertainment law, environmental law, intellectual property and tax law.
Today, the UCLA Law alumni community is more than 15,000 strong and extends around the world. Alumni live and practice in virtually every state, the District of Columbia, multiple U.S. territories and more than 50 foreign nations. These graduates excel in their chosen fields, from private practice to business to government to public interest and beyond. We have a long tradition of distinction on the bench, with more than 320 alumni who are serving, or have served, on courts throughout the country. Six UCLA Law alumni are now judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit – the largest number of graduates from any one law school who are serving on the court.
We take pride in these achievements and recognize that the strength of UCLA Law is a direct result of the superlative work of our faculty and staff, the talents of our diverse and academically gifted student body, and the accomplishments and unstinting generosity of our alumni. By building on past successes, UCLA Law continues to propel the school, students, faculty and alumni into a future of unparalleled distinction.",,,,,,,,72,Education,,,,1,,2022-02-15,"$400,000.0",Grant,,,,"$400,000.0",LuminaFoundation,1,1,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,"120,017",,-0.1,1.4,-0.1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,142,,,

The Engineering Department was situated downtown, on the Bogyoke Aung San street. B.Sc. (Engineering) program in Civil Engineering began in 1924. However, in 1972, with the construction of the B.O.C. College of Mining and Engineering in the university estate, the Department of Engineering was moved to that place. The Department was upgraded to become the Faculty of Engineering in 1964 headed by the Dean of Engineering under the Rangoon (Yangon) University. New academic departments were opened at the B.O.C. College: Mechanical Engineering (1951); Electrical Engineering.(1951); Mining Engineering (1953); Chemical Engineering (1954); Metallurgy (1954); Architecture (1954); Textile Engineering (1955). There were eight Departments at the B.O.C. College by 1955 including Civil Engineering Department. As the scope of Engineering Education became more extensive, a larger complex was constructed at Gyogone in Insein Township and the Faculty of Engineering was moved to that place in 1961. It was called Burma Institute of Technology (B.I.T.), which was later renamed as Rangoon (Yangon) Institute of Technology (R.I.T.) in 1963 and has been known as Yangon Technological University (Y.T.U.) since July 1, 1998.
With the introduction of the new education system in 1964, professional institutes were born and R.I.T. was one of them having all the rights and status of a full-fledged University. Direct 6-year B.E. /B.Arch. programmes were initiated. In 1965, the Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree was first offered instead of the B.Sc.(Engineering) degree offered while under the Rangoon University. In 1968, Master of Engineering (M.E.) courses were first opened in two Departments only (Civil Engineering. and Chemical Engineering.), eventually in other departments as well. Ph.D. programmes in Engineering and Applied Sciences began in 1997. From 1997 to 2011, new undergraduate students were not admitted at Y.T.U. due to the prevailing circumstances but they were admitted only at the new Universities and Colleges for the new threestep ladder-like technical education system. Only some post-graduate programmes remained at Y.T.U. in that period. However, in 2012, Y.T.U. was reopened for the undergraduate studies and is now offering twelve six-year Bachelor of Engineering/ Architecture undergraduate programmes as well as numerous postgraduate Diploma, Master and Ph.D. programmes in a variety of disciplines, totaling 78 programmes. Nine of the undergraduate programmes are provisionally accredited by FEAIP (Federation of Engineering Institutions in Asia and the Pacific).

Enter IYRS, a school founded initially to reinvigorate and teach these skills in the world of boat craft and restoration. Along the way, those traditional and cutting edge skills, and the hands-on way IYRS teaches them, have helped IYRS develop a whole new experiential education model—a model that prepares deeply technical and ultra-talented craftspeople and technicians to work with a range of materials, and to maintain a range of mechanical systems, to help industry and the individual. That educational model is this: students immersed both body and spirit, with a team equally dedicated, in a condensed timeframe, to transform materials and systems into useful, lasting things, and in so doing transforming their own lives and careers. When we build with our hands, immersed with others in the task, we become attuned to the importance of all that we do. At IYRS, students learn to make, restore and maintain things with this heightened sense of purpose and craft, becoming truly in demand across industries.

colleges. It also offers online courses, most of which lead to graduate
and doctoral degrees. Business, education, nursing, and kinesiology are
some of the subjects included in the online school.
The university also has much to offer in terms of student life. The city
of Statesboro, which houses GSU, offers southern city charm with a
college-town feel. The Botanical Garden, Center for Wildlife Education,
and Lamar Q Ball, Jr. Raptor Center provide a natural haven to GSU
students. You can also check out exhibits at the Georgia Southern Museum
or the Betty Foy Sanders Department of Art, or catch a show at the
Performing Arts Center.
Financial aid at Georgia Southern is plentiful as well. Scholarships are
based primarily on merit, and some are awarded to students in particular
colleges. GSU also offers an out-of-state fee waiver, so students who
meet certain academic criteria can pay in-state tuition.",,,,,,11-50,,35,,,,1001-5000,1,,2022-06-28,"$25,000.0",Grant,,,,"$25,000.0",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,1,1,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,"153,714",,-0.2,-0.4,7.2,3,"Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Legal, Management, Marketing, Medical &amp; Science, Operations, Pro Services, Sales","1,209","1,696,616","2,891,418.33",-66.64%,533,-40.84%,4.13,-27.18%,29.55%,43.66%,"71,932","44,412",161.38%,114,10,218,,1,0,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,,,,,,,,,,,,,,108,,,

Education.
Since most programs take a year or less to complete, the time spent in
school is short. For that reason it is also intense and focused.
Students in all of CTE’s programs learn through hands-on work in their
field. Not only that, but as soon as students begin their program at CTE
they are assigned employment consultants.
Consultants help them throughout the year with resume writing, mock
interviews, job-searching and obtaining part-time work in their field
while still in school.
Consultations for additional issues are also offered for students who
have never worked due to disability or other impediments.
Financial aid is available for eligible students. Instructions on how to

academic and social environment as well as numerous opportunities both
within and beyond the classroom.
Located in Frederick, Maryland, Hood College’s small campus is made up of
beautiful historic buildings and natural beauty.
Academics at Hood are based in the liberal arts and include more than 25
major subjects at the undergraduate level and over a dozen master’s
degrees.
With a low faculty ratio and a relatively small student body classes
remain small giving students optimum one-on-one time with professors.
This is particularly exciting since most professors hold a terminal
degree.
However, while small, Hood is not lacking in opportunities. Encouraging
students to do internships in their field of study, Hood can often offer
positions at such places as American Red Cross, CNN, the French Embassy,
National Geographic, the Library of Congress and the White House.
Most students live on campus in one of Hood’s residence halls. This gives
them the chance to regularly take advantage of Hood’s student life
offerings. These include more than 60 student clubs and organizations,
honors societies and NCAA athletics.
The admission requirements to Hood vary depending on whether one is a
freshman, transfer student or graduate school applicant.

personalized services that provide counseling, career coaching, academic

In 1769, it was closed upon the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Philippines. It reopened in 1783 along Martires Street on the initiative of Bishop Mateo Joaquin de Arevalo under the name Colegio-Seminario de San Carlos, named after St. Charles Borromeo, the great patron of ecclesiastical training in the Renaissance. In 1867, the Vincentians took over the administration of San Carlos. 
One of the top universities outside Manila, the University of San Carlos enjoys an environment free from the hustle and bustle that often distracts students in the capital. But the difference stops there. As the business and tourist hub of Southern Philippines, Metro Cebu provides Carolinians (as USC students are called) with a cosmopolitan setting where malls are just a few minutes away from the beaches, heritage towns, or mountain resorts. 
With its four campuses housing all levels of educational programs that include eight colleges and 27 departments, USC is truly a “universe-city” in its own right. International linkages now External Affairs and a steady influx of foreign students and visiting professors have made USC a multicultural academic community bonded by the common pursuit for global standards. 
A mix of old and new marks USC’s brand of education. The missionary spirit is kept alive with the school’s pursuit for the latest in science, technology, and the arts. A sense of heritage blends well with the Carolinian enthusiasm for the new. And this is best shown in the increasingly eclectic look of the school’s architecture. 
In general, USC is busy getting a makeover. But as modern buildings rise in the campuses, ancient ones are carefully preserved. Thus, the newly-renovated façade of the Main Campus looks as fresh as when it rose from the rubbles of the Second World War during the University’s period of reconstruction. 
A recent campaign to name the buildings, halls, and premises after past administrators and individual patrons who contributed greatly to the University’s growth helps to give today’s Carolinians a sense of campus history. Students often wonder why most of the names are those of foreigners. Then they realize that their school has always had that international character and so gearing up for the challenges of the future, today’s global-minded Carolinian never stops to pay tribute to the past.",,,,,,,,3,"Education, Other",3,"Antonio Pereira, Antonio Sedeno, Pedro Chirino",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,"177,520",,2.2,3.4,2.5,165,Operations,3,"484,928","266,573.17",138.43%,552,11.74%,3.27,5.49%,41.22%,-3.94%,"179,118","-130,148",-42.08%,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,
