Finally, in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.
Facebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ] with shares trading at $42.05.

A global Fortune 500 company, Lenovo is the world's largest PC vendor and fourth largest smartphone company.
While the Lenovo brand came into existence only in 2004, the company has a much longer history. In 1984, Legend Holdings was formed with 200,000 RMB (US$25,000) in a guard house in China. The company was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1988 and would grow to be the largest PC company in China. Legend Holdings changed its name to Lenovo in 2004 and, in 2005, acquired the former Personal Computer Division of IBM, the company that invented the PC industry in 1981.
Today, Lenovo is a US$39billion personal technology company with more than 54,000 employees (including joint ventures) in more than 60 countries serving customers in more than 160 countries. Lenovo is a global company that is incorporated and headquartered in Hong Kong, with operational centers located strategically around the world , with the largest in Beijing and Morrisville, NC. These operational centers drive Lenovo’s global and local business approach.
Lenovo has grown faster than the market for more than four years because our exceptionally engineered products are meant for those who do. Our customers use innovation to bring progress to the world, and we design and build our products with this in mind, taking inspiration from the drive and imagination of the people who make things happen. Our technology helps those who do, do better.
 
Whether a PC, smartphone, tablet, smart TV, server, workstation or storage, Lenovo makes the products that customers need for what we call the ""PC+ world."" Lenovo is creating real differentiation from the competition thanks to its vertically integrated end-to-end business model. This model is unique among major PC makers and is a significant source of competitive advantage, helping us to bring more innovation to market, more efficiently, and aggressively attack the PC+ opportunity.
And as Lenovo expands globally, we are establishing even deeper roots in each major market, investing not only in sales and distribution, but also in local domestic manufacturing, R&amp;D and other high-value functions.

Today the EBRD uses the tools of investment to help build market economies and democracies in countries from central Europe to central Asia.
The EBRD is the largest single investor in the region and mobilises significant foreign direct investment beyond its own financing. It is owned by 61 countries and two intergovernmental institutions. But despite its public sector shareholders, it invests mainly in private enterprises, usually together with commercial partners.
It provides project financing for banks, industries and businesses, both new ventures and investments in existing companies. It also works with publicly owned companies, to support privatisation, restructuring state-owned firms and improvement of municipal services.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years.
President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge.
Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites.
After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations.
NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner.
Throughout its history, NASA has conducted or funded research that has led to numerous improvements to life here on Earth.",,Venture Capital,Early Stage Venture,,,,,,"Government and Military, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",1,Dwight D.

Airbase,2017,"Finance, Financial Services, FinTech","San Francisco, California, United States",Airbase serves as an all-in-one spend management platform that helps companies with their financial control and visibility.,850,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,$1M to $10M,Active,,,For Profit,www.airbase.com,https://twitter.com/AirbaseHQ,https://www.facebook.com/AirbaseHQ,https://www.linkedin.com/company/airbaseinc,sales@airbase.io,800-604-4380,162,Emerging Unicorn,"Airbase is the only spend management platform that scales for companies from founding to IPO and beyond. It brings together three products: a comprehensive accounts payable automation system, a leading-edge corporate card program, and fully automated employee expense reimbursements. Simply put, it handles every dollar of non-payroll spend that leaves a company, from initial request for spend, to booking to the general ledger.
Spend management is a different approach and a new way of thinking about how companies spend money. It shifts the relationship between employees and the budget by building accountability into fast-paced workflows and supporting ownership of spending, which are especially vital functions for a distributed workforce.
Companies customize approval workflows to ensure the appropriate routing of requests while building an audit trail of compliance for every purchase. Approvals occur in Slack, email, or the Airbase mobile app so that approvers can quickly review and approve or ask questions without having to leave their working communication environment. Accounting automation tools for scheduling, accruing, amortizations, and categorizing transactions save time and eliminate errors. A full selection of payment types, including virtual cards, physical cards, checks, ACH, and vendor credits, all from one control center, make AP teams efficient and even open opportunities to optimize returns by selecting payment types that generate cash back whenever possible. When every dollar of non-payroll spend is handled on one platform, actual spending against the budget can be viewed any day of the week by all stakeholders.
Airbase improves operations across the whole company. Employees are empowered to safely and easily get the resources they need to be productive. Managers have oversight and control of their budgets. Finance teams are more efficient with accounting automation. Leadership has access to real-time data for better decision-making. All benefit from Airbase’s well-designed and intuitive user interface that is easy to onboard and simple to use.
Finance teams in small and mid-market companies are underserved by existing process automation tools for accounts payable and expense management. The resulting cobbled-together solutions, inefficient processes, and manual workflows place strain on finance teams and can confuse or frustrate employees. Airbase’s single platform solution can replace many of the software tools that are widely used, including spreadsheets, Expensify, Bill.com, Brex, and AMEX. This replacement streamlines processes, eliminates cross-platform reconciliation needs, and even reveals wasted spend. The Airbase platform consolidates three functional areas without asking users to compromise on the quality or functionality expected from a best-of-breed solution. This allows companies to enjoy the benefits of having everything available in one place and standardized to the same workflows without missing the value of legacy point solutions.
Current practices can stymie growth, degrade decision-making, and relegate finance staff to low-value manual work. Airbase gives companies the efficiencies they need to grow, from founding to IPO, without investing heavily in back-office staff. The Airbase spend management solution unlocks trapped talent, provides visibility and control over all non-payroll spend, shortens the close, and provides better budget management so you can build a great company.",,,,,,,,,Financial Services,1,Thejo Kote,251-500,5,,2022-07-15,"150000000,0",Debt Financing,"11000000,0",Venture - Series Unknown,"101500000,0","251500000,0","Alumni Ventures, Goldman Sachs, Craft Ventures, BoxGroup, Quiet Capital",5,22,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,2022-08-17,,1,856,,-1.2,5.0,9.3,7,"Engineering, Finance, Management, Marketing, Operations, Product, Sales",42,"43,304","67,251.67",-44.02%,190,-37.91%,2.25,19.54%,59.76%,-1.13%,"922,490","330,484",55.82%,26,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
