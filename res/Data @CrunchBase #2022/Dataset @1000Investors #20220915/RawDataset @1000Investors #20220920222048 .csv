The firm invests in a number of highly promising startups and uses its programs to advance product development, acquire customers, and scale. SOSV companies consistently achieve funding led by top tier investors. SOSV joins seed, series A, and later rounds.
As of January 2022, SOSV had more than 1,000 portfolio companies and $1.2 billion in assets under management, reflecting a 40% increase over 2020. Among the top companies in SOSV’s portfolio are NotCo, Perfect Day, Upside Foods, Yeelight, Opentrons, Shopal, Snapask, BitMEX, and API3.
SOSV’s programs include hard tech-oriented HAX and life-science driven IndieBio. Both offer deep technical and regulatory expertise on-site as well as well-equipped lab and fabrication facilities. At Chinaccelerator and MOX, market-entry and product development experts help entrepreneurs win cross-border market opportunities across Asia. SOSV’s latest program, dlab, fosters new players in blockchain.
Founder Experience
SOSV programs review applications from all over the world, and any pre-seed or seed-stage company is welcome to apply. SOSV provides $150,000 - $250,000 in exchange for equity, but certain biotech startups may receive as much as an additional $250,000 or more from the Genesis Consortium, a partnership between IndieBio and leading VCs and industry partners, including co-founding partner Mayfield.
Founders spend 4-6 months in a formative cohort experience marked by coaching from on-staff experts (including alums), regular workshops led by mentors and guests, and access to technical resources, including engineers, labs, and other facilities.
After a program’s completion, the SOSV partners continue working closely with founders to bring on lead investors for follow-on investment. Unlike most startup programs, SOSV continues to invest as a major syndicate participant—up to 20% of new rounds—in subsequent seed, series A, and later investments. In 2020, SOSV invested $46 million in post-program rounds; in total, SOSV portfolio companies in 2020 raised $1 billion. In June 2021, SOSV announced the close of the $100 million SOSV Select Fund, which is designed to invest in the series B and later rounds of its portfolio companies.
In addition to funding, SOSV continues to support founders and their startups long after their programs are complete. SOSV provides expert legal resources, sales and customer development, and mentorship resources across many disciplines. Founders are also encouraged to tap the 2,000+ SOSV founder network.

Due to the current global COVID-19 crisis, we have adapted our program to be delivered entirely online. As we follow the guidance of public health officials, we will re-evaluate periodically to decide when to transition back to in-person format. CDL will not turn away ventures that have applied to a specific location if they are not able to attend a session in-person, as there is still uncertainty around the COVID-19 situation.","74",https://twitter.com/creativedlab,https://www.linkedin.com/school/creative-destruction-lab/,https://www.facebook.com/creativedestructionlab,"—","—","—","738","—","147","33","43","3","—","7.2","2.3","-0.5","—","$1M to $10M","Active","Aug 1, 2012","—","—","Non-profit","www.creativedestructionlab.com/","info@creativedestructionlab.com","—","Crunchbase Venture Program","—","Early Stage Venture, Seed","Entrepreneurship Program, University Program","Jul 30, 2021","On-Site","40","—","—",—,"0","3","—","Machines and machine tools","14","—","—","64","371,894","117,836.33","140.82%","1,664","940%","1.16","-25.91%","89.65%","3.43%","215,733","-156,962","-42.12%","Engineering, Management, Operations, Pro Services, Sales","93","314",—,"874","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","Bank of Montreal, SCALE AI, RBC Capital, Government of Canada, Alberta Innovates",—,—,"4","—","Jun 2, 2022",—,"Grant",—,"Venture - Series Unknown",—,—,"2","Ajay Agrawal, Anthony Lacavera","101-250","Artificial Intelligence, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Other, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software, Sustainability, Transportation","Advanced Materials, Aerospace, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, CleanTech, Retail Technology, Risk Management, Supply Chain Management","—","—","—","—","—"

We support early-stage ventures with a 501c3 nonprofit that operates training programs for founders, investors, and communities. We also manage a for-profit, managed investment fund that provides early-stage capital to top graduates of each program, as selected by their peers. Our unique peer-selection model received McKinsey/Harvard Business Review’s prestigious M-Prize for innovation in 2013, and we have supported more than 550 enterprises across 51 programs in 9 countries.
Since 2009, Village Capital has supported more than 1,000 entrepreneurs through our programs and partnered with affiliated investment funds, including VilCap Investments, that have invested seed capital in more than 90 program graduates.

Twice a year, Chinaccelerator handpicks a small number of promising startups and invites them to join the company's accelerator program in return for ~6% equity. Chinaccelerator then invests $150,000 USD via convertible equity or directly into rounds actively being raised. Participating startups move to Shanghai where Chinaccelerator helps optimize product-market fit, develop local growth strategies, and close out the program with a focus on packaging our progress to investors. Each cycle culminates in a Demo Day, where the startups present their companies to a carefully curated audience.
Chinaccelerator doesn’t end on Demo Day; the startups are encouraged to work from our offices rent free until the start of the next program and to continue to take advantage of all its resources. Chinaccelerator's in-house team then gets to work getting you funded, which means not only finding and encouraging investors but also closing them. Chinaccelerator has an active alumni and investor network who contribute to and share in the resources of the program wherever they go.
Chinaccelerator is an SOSV program. SOSV is a global venture capital firm that operates startup accelerator investment programs. At the close of 2020, SOSV had more than 1,000 portfolio companies and $855 million in assets under management.","131",http://twitter.com/chinaccelerator,http://www.linkedin.com/company/chinaccelerator,http://www.facebook.com/Chinaccelerator,"—","—","—","216","—","33","13","4","16","—","-1.5","-2.5","6.9","—",—,"Active","2010","—","—","—","chinaccelerator.com","cateam@chinaccelerator.com","—","Crunchbase Venture Program","—","Early Stage Venture, Seed","Accelerator","Aug 6, 2021","On-Site","12","—","—",—,—,—,"—",—,"21","—","—","65","4,150","4,722.17","-34.88%","1,255","43.76%","1.52","-59.8%","82.53%","88.55%","3,687,661","1,032,615","38.89%","Operations","10","4,312",—,"43,612","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—","—","2","Cyril Ebersweiler, Sean O'Sullivan","11-50","Financial Services, Internet Services, Mobile, Software","FinTech, Internet, Mobile, Software","—","—","—","—","—"

Founded in 2008, betaworks is a company of builders. A tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, products and data brought together in imaginative ways to build out a more connected world. At first glance we seem to do many things. But first and foremost, we're builders, seeking to create a more sustainable innovation model. The more we build, the more we learn, the more we get ideas for peripheral things, all related, connected -- in a loosely coupled network of products and companies. 
betaworks is structured as a company-- a single company that owns larger pieces of the things it has built and smaller pieces of the things it has invested in. It operates as a network: a tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, and data united to build out a more inspired and useful connected world. betaworks makes seed-stage investments in this ecosystem. To us, seed investing means ""first money in."" Our typical investment size is $150,000-200,000. We always invest as part of a syndicate of angels and early stage VCs. Our requirements from an investment perspective are simple, though narrow. Investments must be early stage, heavily tech focused, and have a working (public or private) prototype. We are a powerpoint-free zone.
We build and work closely with companies that we view as core to our vision, examples include: [Summize/Twitter Search](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/summize/), [bitly](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bitly-2), [TweetDeck](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tweetdeck), [Chartbeat](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chartbeat). And more recently, [Digg](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/digg/), [Dots](http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/dots-the-most-beautiful-mobile-game-ive-ever-seen/), [Giphy](http://www.Giphy.com) and [Instapaper](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Instapaper), which betaworks acquired in April of 2013. We attract the kind of people who could start their own company, but they don't necessarily want to run a company. They'd rather be the co-founder of eight things than tied down for years as the sole founder of one. They'd rather build.","1,317",http://twitter.com/betaworks,https://www.linkedin.com/company/betaworks,http://www.facebook.com/pages/betaworks/135088823175402,"—","—","—","171","—","28","36","70","2","—","-1","-2","-1.7","—","$1M to $10M","Active","2007","—","—","—","www.betaworks.com","info@betaworks.com","—","Crunchbase Venture Program","—","Debt, Early Stage Venture, Seed","Micro VC","—","—","—","—","—","$248,539","0","3","—","Insurance; financial affairs","—","13","—","49","16,243","7,044","167.77%","196","141.98%","1.73","21.72%","28.05%","-64.43%","1,670,776","-1,041,099","-38.39%","Management, Operations","5","1,364",—,"7,513","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","Made Acquisitions","The New York Times, GGV Capital, Headline, Lerer Hippeau, SV Angel",—,—,"6","—","Mar 11, 2019","—","Venture - Series Unknown","—","Venture - Series Unknown",—,—,"3","Andy Weissman, Billy Chasen, John Borthwick","11-50","Financial Services, Internet Services, Lending and Investments, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate","Angel Investment, Coworking, Social Media","—","—","—","—","—"

Because our approach is so entrepreneur-focused, we are comfortable investing at the earliest of stages, often before any other investors.
We make investment decisions quickly. Very soon after our first meeting, we will either pass or articulate a discrete roadmap to a decision.
We will invest as little as $50k and as much as $750k in a company’s initial financing.
We prefer being a lead investor and guiding our entrepreneurs to the key milestones for a successful venture round. We dislike “headless” seed rounds that lack a lead investor.
Post investment we immediately focus on ensuring these milestones are clearly defined, and work to help our entrepreneurs achieve them.

While he learned his earliest lessons in leadership and web design from his high school Quake 2 clan and Everquest guild, Alexis continued his official studies at the University of Virginia, where he met his future co-founder Steve Huffman during freshman year move-in day. This would lead to the founding of reddit, which he recounted along with many lessons for entrepreneurs, in his national bestseller, Without Their Permission.
At UVA, Alexis majored in business and history with a minor in German. Though he had originally planned to become an immigration lawyer, he experienced an epiphany in his junior year (while sitting in a Waffle House) that led him to the realization that he didn't want to practice law. Instead he convinced his best friend Steve to start a company with him.
The pair traveled to Cambridge, MA during their senior year spring break to hear Paul Graham give a talk titled ""How to Start a Startup."" After the lecture, Alexis invited Graham out for a drink so he and Steve could pitch Graham on their business idea. Graham agreed, loved the idea, and suggested they apply to a new seed stage venture firm he'd launched called Y Combinator.
Alexis and Steve's original plan was to build an infrastructure that would allow people to order food from their cell phones. Though the idea was rejected, Alexis and Steve were invited to join the first class of Y Combinator, on the condition that they'd come up with a new concept. The next idea they pitched to Graham would become reddit.com.","1,681",http://twitter.com/alexisohanian,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisohanian,https://www.facebook.com/alexis.ohanian,"Founder &amp; General Partner",—,—,"145",—,"2","29","41","12",—,"0","7.3","-0.3","—",—,"—","—","—","—","—","alexisohanian.com/","—","—","—","—","Seed","Investment Partner, Individual/Angel","—","—","—","—","—",—,—,—,"—",—,"—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—",—,"4,858",—,—,"—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—","—",—,"—",—,"—","—","—","—","—","—","—"

Our company invests in start-up ventures, and we also hold advisory posts and serve as external directors of some venture companies.
Background: Social and Economic Legislation
Whereas venture capital investment is at about 30 billion dollars in U.S. and 24 billion dollars in Europe, Japan was only at about 0.86 billion dollars (2005), and the Japanese investment ratio is only about 30 / 1. On the other hand, by the legal deregulation progresses as seen in new business laws, increasingly in the future Japanese funding is expected to expand. 
Samurai Incubate Inc. was established to help companies to develop vision and strength and to realize their greater revenue potential. We support practical expertise in marketing and sales management personnel as well as clear financial strategies to monetize our start-ups.
Our company's name, ""Samurai Incubate, Inc.,"" derives from the Japanese samurai spirit with a pure eight-part Code of Conduct:
* Righteousness: Be sincere all the time not only internal, but also external.
* Thanks: Forbid inhuman conduct and show respect to conduct against internal and external.
* Courage: Be in the vanguard who are afraid of taking action.
* Honor: Enphasize on honer, and with it the value of his own.
* Humanity: Respect the spirit of love and help compatriots in any situation.
* Sincerity: Be sincere and honest on your action and words.
* Loyalty: Do your best with your loyalty for your master and people who you believe in.
* Challenge: Aim and challenge the goals, and accomplish them excess 120%.
By following those eight parts of our Code of Conduct, we want to convey not only to clients and users but also to people around the world, ""It does not matter whether we can do it or cannot do it. We can change the world by taking action!""

EXPERTS IN EXPANSION
Founders see what the world misses. In fast pursuit of opportunity, you make critical decisions with little certainty. We get it, because we’ve been there.
Frontline is the venture firm for globally ambitious B2B companies on both sides of the Atlantic.
Frontline Seed speeds up ideas at inception across Europe. Frontline X is a growth-stage fund, for fast and frictionless US-Europe expansion.
WE'VE LEARNED IT THE HARD WAY
As a team of entrepreneurs, we have built many businesses, many ways. And as a venture fund, we’ve helped tens of founders and CEOs cross the pond.
We’ve scaled too – with team members in Dublin, London and San Francisco.
Today, our team, LPs and advisors represent senior leadership at many of the world’s most successful B2B companies (Think: Segment, Stripe, Looker, Linkedin, Airtable, Google and Workday – to name a few).
Collectively, we can add value when founders need it most – at company defining moments.
CAPITAL IS CHEAP
Look around; the venture market is drowning in noise. Hundreds of funds and millions of blogposts – all claiming to “add value” left and right.
We believe that capital is cheap, and we know that value-add is not made equal.
Our focus is clear; we back challengers with global ambition, and we dedicate our time to helping them fly higher – faster. Our experience makes us knowledgeable. Our global network makes us unique.
Want more detail or first-hand accounts? we are happy to introduce you to our founders.
SYMBIOSIS
In nature, the best things work together. We see the landscape ahead and can warn you of the risks, while you stay strong and focused on your goals.
Indispensable; that’s how we see our relationship.","138",https://twitter.com/Frontlinevc,https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontline-ventures,https://www.facebook.com/frontlineventures,"—","—","—","84","—","58","2","14","1","—","1.4","1.2","5.9","—",—,"Active","2012","—","—","—","www.frontline.vc","info@frontline.vc","—","Crunchbase Venture Program","—","Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture, Seed","Venture Capital","—","—","—","—","—",—,—,—,"—",—,"19","—","—","34","3,481","3,365.67","-56.68%","1,635","2,080%","5.23","75.83%","34.9%","46.7%","3,956,440","1,636,025","70.51%","Finance, Legal, Management, Operations","6","8,051",—,"98,315","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—","—","2","Shay Garvey, Will Prendergast","11-50","Financial Services, Lending and Investments","Finance, Financial Services, Venture Capital","—","—","—","—","—"

Since 1981, Rho Ventures has been investing in innovators that redefine the status quo. Rho’s investment philosophy does not fit a conventional model, much like the visionary innovators we back. We believe that formulaic approaches to investing lead to risk averse strategies that stifle innovation and differentiation. We actively avoid restrictive boundaries around ideas, growth opportunities and entrepreneur profiles. To find extraordinary opportunities, we are not bound by a particular stage of investment and do not shy away from contrarian ideas.
We believe that great companies take root in unconventional places and that successful entrepreneurs frequently break the mold. The ideas we back come from a variety of sources: an MBA student who is trying to change new media advertising practices; an experienced entrepreneur seeking to commercialize a disruptive biofuels technology; or an executive looking to spin out and develop an abandoned asset developed by a pharmaceutical company. 
We are seasoned investors who have backed more than 200 companies through multiple cycles. Identifying interesting opportunities and providing capital is just the beginning. We offer deep-sector expertise in today’s high-growth markets, but we do not let any one area of knowledge guide our overall investment strategy.
Ultimately, we look for entrepreneurs who we can help make very big waves, not just stir the waters and move on to the next venture.","291",http://twitter.com/rhoventures,http://www.linkedin.com/company/85331,—,"—","—","—","80","—","31","9","43",—,"—","0.3","0","-0.2","—",—,"Active","1981","—","—","—","www.rhoventures.com","businessplans@rho.com","514.844.5605","Crunchbase Venture Program","—","Debt, Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture, Private Equity, Seed","Private Equity Firm, Venture Capital","—","—","—","—","—",—,—,—,"—",—,"3","—","—","15","558","—","—","0","—","1","—","100%","—","8,012,834","—","—","Finance, Operations","2","13,563",—,"148,089","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—","—","1","Joshua Ruch","101-250","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Sustainability","CleanTech, Financial Services, Venture Capital","—","—","—","—","—"

"Boston Harbor Angels","124","17","Boston, Massachusetts, United States","Boston Harbor Angels is a group of proven business leaders interested in investing a portion of their assets in high growth, early stage","—","—","Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England","—","Boston Harbor Angels is a group of proven business leaders interested in investing a portion of their assets in high growth, early stage companies. The group was formed in February 2004 and since then has made a number of investments in companies in medical devices, IT, consumer products, business products, specialty materials, Internet, aviation, etc. They believe they contribute more than money to the companies they fund and welcome the opportunity to work with entrepreneurs open to take advice, yet having the smarts and determination to make the company successful.
Their focus is on early stage companies usually looking to raise $250K to $1.5M, where they can fund a portion of the round and syndicate the deal with other angel groups or early stage venture funds. The stage of the company should be close to commercialization, while the company should have a clear and defensible competitive advantage. They are looking for capital efficient businesses, which can reach profitability with less than $5M of equity investment and provide at least 10X return on the investment within 5 years.
They do not invest as a fund - each of their members makes his or her individual investment decision but they collaborate in Due Diligence. They have a deep expertise in the life sciences field where they usually take the position of a lead investor, but are open to any opportunities that can make a strong business case. In some cases they prefer to be the follow on investor if they cannot identify a person with strong expertise within their group.
The groupâ€™s strategy is directed by an executive committee which consists of 8 people elected by the group: Wayne Griffith (chairman), Bill McPhee, Henry Kay, Jay Schwartz (membership director), Steve Andress, Peter Miller, Don Freeman and Mic Williams (president and founder). The groupâ€™s day-to-day operations are managed by Boris Batchvarov (managing director).
They receive 20-30 business summaries each month, out of which they select 8 companies to make a personal presentation to their screening committee. The screening committee consists of volunteers from the group. The presentations are 10 min long followed by 10 min Q&amp;A. 4 of the companies are invited to present to the whole group, with the idea to get the people interested and decide to perform a Due Diligence with the companies before making an investment.","24",https://twitter.com/bhainvestors,https://www.linkedin.com/company/boston-harbor-angels-inc./,https://www.facebook.com/boston-harbor-angels-358268851176559,"—","—","—","105","—","9","22","17",—,"—","0.7","1.2","-1.2","—","$1M to $10M","Active","2004","—","—","—","www.bostonharborangels.com","info@bostonharborangels.com","—","—","—","Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture, Seed","Angel Group","—","—","—","—","—",—,—,—,"—",—,"12","—","—","29","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","Management, Operations","6","53,929",—,"464,720","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—","—","1","Mic Williams","1-10","Financial Services, Lending and Investments","Finance, Financial Services, Venture Capital","—","—","—","—","—"

Fondaction helps Québecers prepare for retirement by offering affordable retirement savings to everyone. The savings collected are invested in companies across Québec. This way, Fondaction helps create and maintain quality jobs, contributing to a stronger, more equitable and greener economy.
Created in 1996, Fondaction is a labour-sponsored fund with assets in excess of one billion dollars collected as retirement savings from more than 131,000 shareholders. Fondaction's direct investments and those made through investment funds support the development of more than 1 050 SMEs in different lines of business, in large part involved in various components of the social economy.
Fondaction has always been resolutely committed to socially responsible finance, from the moment it was created. The principles of sustainable development are integrated in everything it does. Whether investing in businesses directly or in capital markets, Fondaction always applies the principles of responsible investment to the money entrusted by its savers.
Fondaction was one of the first institutions in Québec to make accountability reports an obligation in an effort to improve its practices and contribute to moving sustainable development forward in Québec. It produced its first report on sustainable development in 2006 in accordance with the international standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the highest standards of precision and transparency in economic, social and environmental accountability.

"MMV Capital Partners","114","78","Toronto, Ontario, Canada","MMV Capital Partners is dedicated to providing timely and effective growth capital to emerging technology.","—","—","Great Lakes","—","Growing companies are constantly balancing the issue of raising capital to fuel their expansion versus taking the dilution associated with raising additional capital. The problem is even more acute when runway extension can be the difference between meeting milestones and achieving an upround or not. MMV provides entrepreneurs with an alternative to address this problem. They have a range of creative debt financing approaches that enable a company to get the best of both worlds: additional capital with limited dilution.
A major benefit of MMV is that they deploy their capital quickly and efficiently. Their goal is to make the process as user friendly for their companies as possible. They believe that management time is better spent building their business rather than fundraising. What this means is that typically, upon signing a term sheet, they are able to complete a transaction and provide capital within four weeks. As well, they do not require board representation nor the renegotiation of the shareholder's agreement.
Another major advantage of MMV is that they do not require any financial covenants or guarantees from companies or management teams they provide capital to. This means as an entrepreneur, you get full access to their capital to grow your business, and don't have to worry about tripping a covenant and the resulting negative impact on your business.
They operate in the technology and life sciences sectors. Their key criteria being that a company has a proprietary product or process that is needed by its customers and clearly differentiates itself from its competitors. Within technology they have been most active in the software and communications arenas. Within life sciences they provide financing to both drug development companies and medical device companies.
They have financed a range of companies from those at the pre-product stage of their development to those with over $90 million in annual revenue. Their situations may be different but their underlying need for quick access to less dilutive capital is the same. For example, an early stage company may need additional runway to complete its product and start customer trials before going for its next round of financing. A later stage company may face a circumstance where the IPO window has closed and it needs additional working capital for expanding its business as it waits for the public markets to open. A publicly traded company may need access to capital to complete an acquisition but feels its stock price is depressed. Rather than undertake the time consuming process of completing a road show with institutions to raise additional equity, MMV can quickly provide less dilutive capital allowing management to remain focused on the business.
MMV Financialâ€™s business is built on providing a range of creative financing solutions that allow growing companies fast and efficient access to additional capital with limited dilution.","14",http://twitter.com/MMVFinancial,https://www.linkedin.com/company/mmv-financial/about/,—,"—","—","—","109","—","12","1","78",—,"—","-0.1","-0.2","-0.4","—","$1M to $10M","Active","Aug 24, 2004","—","—","—","www.mmvf.com/","—","—","Crunchbase Venture Program","—","Debt, Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture","Venture Capital","—","—","—","—","—",—,—,—,"—",—,"—","—","—","4","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","Management","1","27,693",—,"243,153","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—",—,"—","—","2","Minhas Mohamed, Ron Patterson","1-10","Financial Services, Mobile, Software","Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Mobile","—","—","—","—","—"

Today the EBRD uses the tools of investment to help build market economies and democracies in countries from central Europe to central Asia.
The EBRD is the largest single investor in the region and mobilises significant foreign direct investment beyond its own financing. It is owned by 61 countries and two intergovernmental institutions. But despite its public sector shareholders, it invests mainly in private enterprises, usually together with commercial partners.
It provides project financing for banks, industries and businesses, both new ventures and investments in existing companies. It also works with publicly owned companies, to support privatisation, restructuring state-owned firms and improvement of municipal services. The Bank uses its close relationship with governments in the region to promote policies that will bolster the business environment.
The mandate of the EBRD stipulates that it must only work in countries that are committed to democratic principles. Respect for the environment is part of the strong corporate governance attached to all EBRD investments.","322",http://twitter.com/ebrd,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ebrd,http://www.facebook.com/ebrd-hq,"—","—","—","98","—","72","3","24","1","—","-1.9","-0.6","7.9","—","$1B to $10B","Active","1991","—","—","—","www.ebrd.com","info@ebrd.com","+44 20 7338 6000","—","—","Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture, Private Equity","Government Office, Investment Bank","—","—","—","—","—","$4,883,833","0","9","—","Advertising; business","23","—","—","86","372,846","251,317.67","92.08%","899","310.5%","2.45","18.33%","51.35%","-14.46%","215,345","-104,082","-32.58%","Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Legal, Management, Operations, Pro Services","498","101",—,"201","Private","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","—","1","—","Feb 14, 2020",—,"Debt Financing","—",—,"—",—,"1","Jacques Attali","1001-5000","Financial Services, Lending and Investments","Banking, Finance, Financial Services, Venture Capital","—","—","—","—","—"
