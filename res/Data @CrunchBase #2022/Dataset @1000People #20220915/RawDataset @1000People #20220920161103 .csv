While he learned his earliest lessons in leadership and web design from his high school Quake 2 clan and Everquest guild, Alexis continued his official studies at the University of Virginia, where he met his future co-founder Steve Huffman during freshman year move-in day. This would lead to the founding of reddit, which he recounted along with many lessons for entrepreneurs, in his national bestseller, Without Their Permission.
At UVA, Alexis majored in business and history with a minor in German. Though he had originally planned to become an immigration lawyer, he experienced an epiphany in his junior year (while sitting in a Waffle House) that led him to the realization that he didn't want to practice law. Instead he convinced his best friend Steve to start a company with him.
The pair traveled to Cambridge, MA during their senior year spring break to hear Paul Graham give a talk titled ""How to Start a Startup."" After the lecture, Alexis invited Graham out for a drink so he and Steve could pitch Graham on their business idea. Graham agreed, loved the idea, and suggested they apply to a new seed stage venture firm he'd launched called Y Combinator.
Alexis and Steve's original plan was to build an infrastructure that would allow people to order food from their cell phones. Though the idea was rejected, Alexis and Steve were invited to join the first class of Y Combinator, on the condition that they'd come up with a new concept. The next idea they pitched to Graham would become reddit.com.",http://twitter.com/alexisohanian,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisohanian,https://www.facebook.com/alexis.ohanian,"1,681","University of Virginia","4","breadpig, Seven Seven Six","145","162","53","29","2","41","41",—,"0","7.3","-0.3"

"Jason Hughes","CEO, Chairman, and Owner","Hughes Marino","San Diego, California, United States","134","Jason","Hughes","Male","Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US","As the founder and CEO of Hughes Marino, Jason Hughes provides national tenant representation to commercial clients. The company, based in San Diego, exists to assist clients with leasing, buying, and building commercial space. The company was one of the first of its kind to exclusively serve the needs of tenants. Jason Hughes has co-managed the business for nearly three decades.
He graduated from Pepperdine University with a Bachelor of Science in business administration. He went on to earn a graduate degree from the University of San Diego. His MBA provided the knowledge he needed to pursue a career in commercial tenant representation.
Despite having two college degrees, Jason Hughes is always eager to learn something new. He’s completed several executive-level educational programs from the following institutions:
— Harvard University
— UCLA Anderson School of Business
— UCSD Rady School of Management
Before launching Hughes Marino, Hughes worked for Cushman &amp; Wakefield in Los Angeles. He decided to move back to San Diego, where he’s from, after several years on the job. Since returning to the city, he’s worked diligently as a tenant representative alongside his wife, Shay. Hughes and Shay primarily work with corporate, municipal, and non-profit clients to help them negotiate a favorable lease or purchase terms.
Thirty years of experience with portfolio lease administration and advisory has attracted attention to Jason Hughes in California and beyond. People are anxious to learn from his expertise, and he’s appeared on several television programs because of it. Numerous publications have featured articles written by Jason Hughes and recognized him as an industry expert. Here are just a handful of those publications:
— C-Suite Quarterly
— Hatch
— Huffington Post
— Wall Street Journal
When Hughes Marino launched in the early 1990s, it was a small, local, and independently owned business. Since then, Hughes and his business partner have expanded operations across the West Coast. They stepped in to fill an unmet need in an industry that heavily favored property owners. Their business was revolutionary at the time and continues to command respect today.
Despite phenomenal growth throughout the 2000s, Hughes Marino remains exclusively committed to commercial renters and buyers. Clients know they will always receive personalized service from a family-owned business.
Jason Hughes cares about his community and gives back as much as possible. One of his greatest concerns is child abuse, and he serves on the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation for that reason. Past president, council member, and board member positions include:
— The New Children’s Museum
— San Diego County Taxpayers Association
— San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art
Commercial leases can be challenging to read, leaving some clients feeling like they don’t understand what they’re signing. Before finalizing complicated or high-dollar deals, tenants and buyers turn to Jason Hughes to represent their best interests. He has closed some of the largest and most complex transactions in San Diego and the surrounding communities. Examples of his work include:
— Build to suit developments
— Contract and expansion negotiations
— Loan and lease workouts
— Negotiations with government officials
— Negotiating contracts before the expiration date
— Project financing negotiations
— Purchases of office buildings, hotels, and condominium developments
His years of experience and record of success have brought Hughes significant recognition in the San Diego business community. He’s received the honor of Most Admired CEO by the San Diego Business Journal. The Irvine Company has bestowed the Broker of the Year award on him more than 10 times. Many other San Diego-based publications have also formally recognized his deep knowledge, hard work, integrity, and desire to serve others.
With all his success in the industry, the one thing Jason Hughes is proudest of is operating a family-owned company. Not answering to a board of directors means he can assure his clients that their interests come first.",—,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-hughes-san-diego/,https://www.facebook.com/jason.hughes.san.diego,"114","Pepperdine University",—,"Hughes Marino",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.2","-0.5","-0.8"

Dockendorf grew up near Baltimore, Maryland, but he would later have a bigger effect overseas. The importance of education was vital to him as it was to many others in the Mid-Atlantic regions.
Dockendorf made an early impression in college. He spent the 1970s cramming for classes and graduated from the University of Vermont in 1981 with honors. Dockendorf, like many others seeking careers and paths in leisure and park management, found himself assisting lecturers. Dockendorf went on to get a Master of Management, in Hospitality from Cornell University and a School of Hotel Administration in 1992. Dockendorf was also the student body president and received the John E.H. Sherry Scholarship at Cornell.
When you develop an institution that lasts over 30 years, it tends to get personal. So it is with John Dockendorf. For 28 years, Hospitality and outdoor recreation consultant Inc. was one of the most well-known teen outdoor programs accessible. Over 25 countries have sent representatives to Dockendorf's program and initiative. All to join in growth-oriented outdoor excursions in some of the best untamed natural locations of the US West, Alaska, and Canada.
The Hospitality and outdoor recreation consultant program was huge. 70 educators, a full-time workforce, and part-time support. The program proved adaptable, even during 2020 and the COVID shutdowns. This was based on the program's long-standing safety reputation. Dave McGlashan, the ten-year director of the Hospitality and outdoor recreation consultant inc, took over from Dockendorf in 2021.
John and Jane also reopened Camp Pinnacle in 2011. Pinnacle, a 1928 legacy summer camp, closed in 2010. The Dockendorfs and Steve Baskin, owner of Camp Champions in Texas, spent ten years remodeling the facility, restoring Camp Pinnacle's status as one of North Carolina's favorite summer camps. Pinnacle now books summer campers a year in advance. After summer 2021, the Dockendorfs will hand over Camp Pinnacle to the Baskins and directors Fayssoux and J G Moss.",https://twitter.com/JohnDockendorf2,https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-dockendorf-47027866/,https://www.facebook.com/john.dockendorf.9?ref=name,"33",—,—,"—",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.2","5.9","9.5"

"Bill Gates","Co-chair","Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation","Seattle, Washington, United States","163","Bill","Gates","Male","Greater Seattle Area, West Coast, Western US","Bill Gates is the founder, technology advisor, and board member of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide leader in software, services, and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential. He served as chairman of the board until Feb. 4, 2014.
On June 27, 2008, Gates transitioned out of a day-to-day role in the company to spend more time on his global health and education work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He shares his thoughts about the foundation and other topics on Gates Notes, a website launched in January 2010. Gates continues to serve on Microsoft’s Board of Directors and as an advisor on key development projects. He is also the Founder of Breakthrough Energy.
Born on Oct. 28, 1955, Gates grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. Their father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. Their late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International.
Gates attended public elementary school and the private Lakeside School. There, he discovered his interest in software and began programming computers at age 13.
In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University as a freshman, where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer – the MITS Altair.
In his junior year, Gates left Harvard to devote his energies to Microsoft, a company he had begun in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Guided by a belief that the computer would be a valuable tool on every office desktop and in every home, they began developing software for personal computers. Gates’ foresight and his vision for personal computing have been central to the success of Microsoft and the software industry.
Under Gates’ leadership, Microsoft’s mission has been to continually advance and improve software technology, and to make it easier, more cost-effective, and more enjoyable for people to use computers. The company is committed to a long-term view, reflected in its industry-leading investment in research and development each year.
In 1999, Gates wrote Business @ the Speed of Thought, a book that shows how computer technology can solve business problems in fundamentally new ways. The book was published in 25 languages and is available in more than 60 countries. Business @ the Speed of Thought has received wide critical acclaim and was listed on the best-seller lists of the New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and Amazon.com. Gates’ previous book, The Road Ahead, published in 1995, was at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for seven weeks.
Gates has donated the proceeds of both books to non-profit organizations that support the use of technology in education and skills development.
In addition to his love of computers and software, Gates founded Corbis, which is developing one of the world’s largest resources of visual information – a comprehensive digital archive of art and photography from public and private collections around the globe. He is also a member of the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invests in companies engaged in diverse business activities.
Philanthropy is very important to Gates. He and his wife, Melinda, started a foundation in 2000 to help reduce inequities in the United States and around the world. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation supports philanthropic initiatives in the areas of global health and learning, with the hope that in the 21st century, advances in these critical areas will be available for all people.

Gates was married on Jan. 1, 1994, to Melinda French Gates. They have three children.

"James Khuri","—",—,"Beverly Hills, California, United States","188","James","Khuri","Male","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US","James Khuri is an American businessman, social media influencer, and wildly successful entrepreneur who has been developing successful, innovative businesses and business models for more than 20 years. His groundbreaking work in restructuring e-commerce platforms has propelled him into the spotlight in recent years as he works tirelessly to builda better e-commerce business model that has a more consumer-friendly global impact.
A businessman from Los Angeles, Khuri’s estimated net worth exceeds $80 million. He is the CEO of nine firms that center on a variety of industries from retail shops to real estate to e-commerce platforms to manufacturing goods and distribution. His strong drive to not only achieve personal success but also make the world a better place, sets him apart from so many garden variety businessmen who are more focused on building their empires than helping build a world that is more inclusive and nurturing for all.
And that is what sets James Khuri apart.
The Early Years
Born in December 1977 in Rochester, New York, Khuri developed a love for trading cards as a young boy. Little did he know that his passion would propel a business that would become a major part of his success as a businessman.
Early on, Khuri exhibited a natural inclination toward business and commerce. After high school, he attended the University of Rochester where he earned a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry. At age 21 Khuri enrolled in the University of Rochester’s Simon School of Business where he earned his MBA. This provided the foundation he needed to forge his success in business while nourishing his entrepreneurial spirit. The fire spread quickly.
At the age of 32, James Khuri made the move from New York to California where he currently resides in the Los Angeles area.
In 2001, he launched a very successful, highly profitable real estate career. Today, Khuri operates under Khuri Enterprises and owns a number of properties including apartment buildings in the Los Angeles area as well as medical buildings in New York. But he didn’t stop there.
Early in his manufacturing and distribution ventures he was cold calling brick and mortar retailers – and getting nowhere. It took years for him to make meaningful connections with the right retailers on that platform. Eventually, he moved to e-commerce and his business took off. He began researching updated and new fulfillment methods and quickly made lasting connections that propelled him to success.
Business Ventures
As a child, James Khuri loved trading cards. As an adult, he was able to turn that passion into an entrepreneurial venture by creating FJ Holdings, a major global distributor of trading cards and related merchandise as well as Hasbro and Mattel products, reaching more than 136 countries. As the CEO, Khuri currently oversees the mass distribution of top brands including Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic the Gathering, and other sports trading cards for Amazon. He also works closely with brick and mortar giants including Walmart as well as other online platforms such as Mercari, and eBay.
These associations have led to several exciting projects including “Fulfilled by Walmart,” which is the company’s move to a massive online e-commerce venture. It is specifically designed to position Walmart as a direct competitor to Amazon and is similar to “Fulfilled by Amazon.” The intent is that it levels the playing field by giving consumers more options and a better atmosphere by creating healthy competition between the two e-commerce giants.
On the other side of the e-commerce landscape, James Khuri has helped Amazon develop a new distribution model that is touted as being unique to the entire system of worldwide distribution. Currently, Amazon has only worked with 10 suppliers across the globe in a similar capacity. Khuri will work in conjunction with Amazon to further this project which is helping the government establish a worldwide online platform.
Vision for a Changing World
James Khuri has repeatedly shown that in order to be successful you have to grow with a changing world. He has demonstrated this again and again. The recent COVID-19 pandemic is no different. He recognized a shift in how the world shops and conducts business as consumer behavior turned increasingly more to the internet and digital devices. This led to his projection that office buildings, shopping centers, and malls would eventually become obsolete – and it would happen sooner rather than later.
He also recognized an increased need for refrigerated warehouse space as large e-commerce companies and supermarkets are increasingly requiring more storage. The shopping habits of consumers have been turning more to online, but the pandemic escalated that change to a dramatic shift in 2020. That is a trend he has said he does not see reversing.
Personal Business Practices
Part of James Khuri’s massive success has been due to his smart business decisions. One of his most notable business practices is that he does not borrow from banks to support his businesses. He believes that banks use lending to control businesses. This is in direct opposition to his father’s advice, “Never show weakness. Control everything” which he has taken to heart.
As a result, he has self-financed five of his companies and has no intention of changing that trend for future companies.
Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs
In a recent Forbes article, James Khuri gave some sage advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. He advises researching and analyzing current trends in order to achieve a better position as a leader within the chosen industry.
He also attributes his ability to continue growing his businesses to focusing on the expansion of his brands. He may have started with selling products from Mattel and Hasbro, but he has expanded that to also sell makeup, health, and tattoo products. This has given him an edge to grow his revenue in a much shorter time than he would have had he focused on expanding outside of his brands.
Smart business strategies are the hallmark of the American dream and James Khuri embodies that. Dream on.",https://twitter.com/KhuriJames,https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-khuri-212626215,https://www.instagram.com/jameskhuri/?hl=en,"46","Simon School of Business, University of Rochester","3","FJ Holdings LLC",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.2","2.5","-1.6"

"James Watt","Co-Founder","BrewDog","Aberdeen, Aberdeen City, United Kingdom","191","James","Watt","Male","—","James Watt is an Aberdeenshire entrepreneur who co-founded one of the world’s most popular craft breweries, BrewDog.
Before embarking on a hop-fuelled journey that would change the face of the beer industry forever, James completed an honours degree in Law and Economics. It didn’t take long for him to discover that the corporate suit-and-tie world of litigation and libel was not for him, so he packed in his career in a law after a few weeks, opting to return to the bitter cold shores of Northeast Scotland to join his father as a fully-qualified Deepsea Captain.
At 24-years-old, James took a new path. Inspired by the bold and experimental beers being crafted by a new movement of brewers on the West Coast of the U.S, James joined forces with friend Martin Dickie, and together the pair started brewing their own beers in Martin’s mum’s garage. In a world dominated by cask bitters and mass-produced lagers, their penchant for heavily-hopped and relentlessly bitter beers made them a unique duo, especially in the town of Fraserburgh. Undeterred by opinion, they pursued their passion through meticulous study, experimentation and boundary-pushing ideas, hellbent on showcasing that beer could be more than just fizzy yellow liquid made by global dominating brewers.
2007 was a seminal year for James. BrewDog became a reality, setting up shop on a derelict industrial estate in Fraserburgh between a needle exchange and ‘The Godfather of Carpets’.
While Martin took the reins on brewing and production, James focused on growing the business, handling accounts and spearheading the brand’s new breed of irreverent marketing that grabbed headlines for years to come. Not only did the pair produce some of the most exciting beers the UK has ever seen, but James also led the charge on Equity for Punks, a ground-breaking new crowdfunding initiative that would be mirrored for years to come by other brands across the globe.
In 2014, James was awarded Great British Entrepreneur of the Year. He is also one of only a handful of people in Europe holding the title of Master Cicerone5, a title reserved for only the most diligent beer experts. In 2016, he was awarded the MBE in the 2016 Queen’s Birthday Honours list. By this time, BrewDog was now 9 years old and boasted a 360-person strong workforce, 26 bars across the UK and Europe, as well as over 14,000 shareholders.
Latter achievements include a number of publishing deals. James released Business for Punks: Break All The Rules – The BrewDog Way and co-wrote BrewDog: Craft Beer for the People. These books both showed the impact that BrewDog had on the beer, from both a business and marketing perspective, as well highlighting the importance of exceptional quality products in a world heavily populated by mainstream beer. But times were changing, and James was at the front of the pack, leading the way and carving a new path for the beer world.
By 2019, James’ passion for sustainability had become integral to the brand. BrewDog was employing over 2,000 people at this time, with 100 bars located around the globe and over 130,000 Equity Punk shareholders. Amazing beer was still at the heart of everything James was doing, but building sustainability into this world was now not a question of if, but when.
So, in 2020, BrewDog announced that they were the world’s first carbon negative brewery – a huge step that would see the industry take note and follow suit with commitments to change the way they do business. James worked closely with Small World Consulting’s Mike Berners-Lee to calculate the businesses carbon emissions and identify ways to reduce these through authentic reforestation programmes, which included a 9,308 acre plot of land in the Scottish Highlands and set forth to embark on one of the largest reforestation projects the UK has ever seen.
In just 15 years, the beer world has transformed. Beyond the liquid in your glass, the breweries at the forefront of the movement are more than just suppliers of a product. They are social commentators, integral to local communities and beacons of quality and change. James has been paramount to these developments, showing that beer can be a force for good.",http://twitter.com/BrewDogJames,https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-watt-21a5a912b,https://www.facebook.com/CaptainJamesWatt,"159",—,"1","BrewDog","5","5",—,—,—,—,—,—,"-0.9","5.5","7.6"

Tom has an investment portfolio that spans multiple industries including technology, logistics, beauty, fashion, health, and medical cannabis. He invests in committed founders and experienced management teams to grow disruptive mission-driven businesses that leverage technology to deliver a better service to consumers and transform the way the world works.
Tom's recent investments include disruptive beauty brand HEYDAY, a one-stop shop for personalised skincare treatments; size-inclusive womenswear brand Universal Standard; Caliva, California's largest fully licensed integrated cannabis dispensary, retailer and distributor; by Humankind, a personal care brand seeking to eliminate single-use plastic; Convoy, which connects truckers with shippers to fill unused trucking capacity, reducing the environmental impact of freight; feminine health brand, OHNE; baby food business, Cerebelly; medical cannabis startup, Plena; and the world’s first stock exchange dedicated to the IPO and trading of commercial real estate assets, IPSX. 
Tom's work as an investor builds on his experience founding MATCHESFASHION.COM, operating at the forefront of the changing face of retail for more than 30 years. With his wife Ruth, they grew the company from a single bricks-and-mortar store to a global luxury fashion brand with a reputation for supporting and nurturing new and emerging talent, and are credited with introducing designers such as Versace, Prada and Bottega Veneta to the UK.
Under Tom's leadership, MATCHESFASHION.COM invested heavily in technology across all areas of the business, enabling the company to better understand the lives of its customers and provide them with a fast, convenient and highly personalised service.
MATCHESFASHION.COM was one of the first luxury brands to go online in 2005; one of the first businesses to launch 90-minute delivery in 2016; and one of the first retailers to build a platform to provide a single truly unified view of customer's shopping across both online and physical channels.
It was, however, his understanding of how digital could radically transform how companies engaged with their customers and his appetite for challenging traditional practices that led to him being inducted into the Business of Fashion’s Hall of Fame in 2018 and being described as a “retail innovator”.
Tom recognised that MATCHESFASHION.COM could use digital not only to reach a global audience quickly but to build highly personal, intimate customer relationships, engaging shoppers with rich, resonant content and storytelling. 
Paired with his challenger mentality, this insight saw Tom transform the company from a 14-store physical retailer into a leading global luxury e-commerce giant. From the launch of their website in 2007, MATCHESFASHION.COM grew at a rate of up to 100 per cent per year, raising £20 million in 2012 for a minority stake in the business.
In 2013, Tom's commitment to digital saw him rebrand all Matches' physical stores as MATCHESFASHION.COM. These decisions collectively enabled the business to accelerate from a valuation of £76m in 2012 to an acquisition price in excess of $1 billion just five years later. In 2017-18, the business had 95 per cent of sales online and 85 per cent internationally.
MATCHESFASHION.COM is also credited with pioneering blended retail, seamlessly bringing together physical and digital commerce to connect with customers over multiple touchpoints – whether that be through the company's events, magazine or private shopping experiences.
Before the sale of the business, Tom conceived of 5 Carlos Place, a five-storey townhouse combining luxury private shopping in a home environment with a purpose-built broadcasting hub and events space focused on creating engaging content for MATCHESFASHION.COM's 100 million annual online visitors.
Carlos Place was an extension of the private-shopping concept behind No.23, which reinvented retail service along the lines of private-client banking, delivering a highly personalised, intimate, bespoke shopping experience. 
Throughout the growth of MATCHESFASHION.COM, Tom has focused on keeping customers and their lifestyles at the centre of all company decisions, recognising that top-class service is the foundation of all consumer-facing businesses and that technology investment should always enable a business to connect better with the consumer and support them. 
Like MATCHESFASHION.COM, many of Tom's investments both challenge the status quo and have strong brands that build deep, personal relationships with customers by connecting with them across both physical and digital touchpoints, and place special importance on social responsibility, inclusiveness and environmental impact.
Having been described as ""trailblazers"" by The New York Times and ""pioneers"" by VOGUE, Tom and Ruth Chapman were awarded Draper's Lifetime Achievement Award for their contributions to fashion retail in 2017. In the same year MATCHESFASHION.COM won British Luxury Brand of the Year at the prestigious Walpole British Luxury Awards.
Tom Chapman, along with his wife Ruth Chapman, were awarded OBEs in the 2020 New Year Honours list for services to the international fashion retail industry.

"James C Dragon","—",—,"Tewksbury, Massachusetts, United States","240","James C","Dragon","Male","Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England","James C. Dragon is a commercial real estate developer and entrepreneur who brings over 30 years of career experience, including nearly 15 years working as an attorney. Since 2000, he has worked in commercial real estate development with his wife, Efthemia “Effie” Poulakos Dragon in the Greater Boston, Massachusetts area. Dragon is currently a managing partner and owner at Central Plaza Realty and Development Company, a position he has held since 2003. He is passionate about commercial real estate development, especially within the city of Lowell, the third-largest in Greater Boston, and the fifth-largest in the Bay State.
A Local Commercial Real Estate Leader
As an owner and managing partner, James C. Dragon has experienced several successes. In 2000, the Dragons acquired the Central Plaza shopping center which was almost half vacant and in need of repairs and some reconstruction. This location was a 266,000 square foot parcel with 94,000 square feet of commercial space. Dragon worked with the City of Lowell to make the capital improvements needed to make the Central Plaza an appealing place to do business. The plaza was originally built in 1965 and served as a Stop &amp; Shop grocery store until 1979 when it was sold.
 
Two other entities owned the plaza between 1979 and 2000 when Dragon and his wife took it over. The Dragons had a vision of a shopping center that offered goods and services that catered to nearby Lowell residents. With property management support from their son William, a licensed commercial real estate agent, James and Effie Dragon eventually developed a plaza that was not only 100% occupied, but also maintained that occupancy through the coronavirus pandemic. At the end of 2021, this downtown Lowell property was sold for nearly $11 million.
Prior to the sale, other Central Plaza Realty successes included the following:
Foodland International: In the spring of 2021, a Foodland International store opened a 16,000 square foot store at Central Plaza, bringing a supermarket to downtown Lowell that served the various cultural and ethnic groups in the area.
Vinfen: In 2019, Vinfen, a health and human services organization opened a location at Central Plaza. Vinfen provides community-based services in the areas of mental health, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and behavioral health.
Discount Valley: In 2015, Discount Valley opened a 15,000-square-foot dollar store at Central Plaza, providing various goods conveniently and affordably for nearby Lowellians.
Other Work History
Central Park Realty wasn’t Dragon’s first foray into real estate. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, Dragon was a co-trustee of Athenaeum Realty Trust when the organization bought a 110,000-square-foot high-rise building in Lowell. The building was to be renovated, serving as the law school for Emerson College. Although the project was canceled by Emerson College, you can see that the commercial real estate bug had bitten Dragon long before the days of Central Park Realty.
Diamond Developers
James and Effie Dragon also owned a minority interest in the New Bedford Bay Sox, a baseball team that played in the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a summer league for athletes who have attended one year of college and have at least one year of eligibility remaining. The Dragons owned a stake through their Sports Done Right, LLC. Originally founded in 1997, the team was originally known as the Torrington Twisters, named for the town in Connecticut. In 2008, the organization relocated to New Bedford, MA, and quickly gained a following in the local community. In 2010, the Dragons joined the Bay Sox ownership. Under their leadership, the team hired former Major League Baseball player Rick Miller to be the manager. The Bay Sox won four regular season Division championships. The Dragons served as part owners of the Bay Sox until the team suspended operations in 2019.
Hobbies and Interests
James C. Dragon has always been a lover of sports, particularly baseball. In addition to part-ownership of the New Bedford Bay Sox, Dragon has participated on amateur baseball teams for several years in Lowell. He also coached youth basketball teams in Tewksbury, including organizing and managing the first-ever American Legion baseball team in Tewksbury which made the playoffs by year two.
Dragon also played basketball as an undergraduate and coached youth basketball. He also loves playing tennis and golf.
Volunteer Organizations and Affiliations
Dragon has lent his time, talents, and treasure to various organizations:
Member, International Council Shopping Center of Owners and Managers
Board of Directors, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church
Board of Directors, Whistler House Museum
Board of Trustees, Sports Museum of New England
Chairman, Middlesex/Essex US Post Office Customary Advisory Council
Member, Lowell YMCA Advisory Committee
Dragon and his wife have also supported and sponsored the Greater Lowell Habitat for Humanity, the Ironstone Horse Farm of Andover, MA, the ALS Foundation, the Kiwanis International Club of Greater Lowell, the D’Youville Senior Center and Nursing Home, and the Lowell Student Police Academy, among others.
Education Background
James C. Dragon graduated from Lynn Classical High School in Lynn, MA, in 1971 where he played varsity basketball and golf. He earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of New Hampshire, and his law degree from the New England School of Law in 1983.",https://twitter.com/jamescdragon,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescdragon,https://www.facebook.com/JJamesCDragon/,"189",—,"1","—",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.7","9.5","10"
"Joel Lavine","—",—,"Del Mar, California, United States","241","Joel","Lavine","Male","Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US","Dr. Joel E. Lavine, MD, Professor at Columbia University, has had a career filled with highlights that showcase his skills and importance to his field. As an academic physician-scientist, he has focused heavily on clinical research, clinical care, teaching, and program administration. 
Understanding his ongoing career can serve as an inspiration for people trying to break into this field, regardless of their age.
A Quick Look at Dr. Joel Lavine's Career
Joel Lavine's career has been focused on many different factors, including identifying and understanding fundamental biological processes and diseases that affect children and require the use of basic science, engineering, computing, and diagnostic tools to handle them correctly. His research is expansive and includes many fields that make him an innovator in a surprising range of topics.
For instance, he has endeavored in the last two decades to bring together pediatrics, internal medicine, pathology, and radiology to help children and adults with obesity. These topics include identifying various treatment methods that may help people with obesity better understand their bodies and the impact that obesity has on them. This research is just 20 years of his very long and successful career.
His primary research interests include the natural history, genetics, biomarker development, and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD. Few people understand the impact of this condition and how damaging it is to the body. Around 25% of all American adults have this condition and may develop cirrhosis, liver cancer, and other diseases due to this condition.
Specific Research Projects Joel Lavine Has Headed
Dr. Joel Lavine has worked on many research projects that have helped identify contributing factors and treatments for NAFLD and other associated diseases during his career. For example, he was one of eight Principal investigators and the only Pediatric Investigator who helped form and serve on the National Institutes of Diabetes, Kidney, and Digestive Diseases (NIDDK) in the NASH Clinical Research Network. He was on the committee as its co-chair for 16 years and helped create all but one of the protocols used for studying pediatric health in this particular field.
In a related pilot study, which was solo-authored and cited over 800 times by other research papers, he gauged whether vitamin E was useful for pediatric NASH and whether it could serve as the basis for various treatments. He created a randomized, double-blind trial test to gauge this drug against a placebo and found that vitamin E could help reduce cellular injury and reverse NASH. Published in 2010, this trial has helped steer other studies into related fields to produce significant treatment results.
Furthermore, Joel Lavine has also expanded his study into gastroenterology since 2015 by investigating a new first-in-class agonist that affects the nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid-X. His studies have helped medical science better understand this problem and how it affects NAFLD. For example, it identified that boys far outnumbered girls with NAFLD and hypothesized that this nuclear hormone was implicated. Studies like these help build the backbone for further research into these related fields.
Other Important Career Milestones
Joel Lavine MD isn't one to rest on his laurels and has continually pushed forward in his field. After 40 years in his field, he continues to innovate and lead bold new studies. That's why it's so hard to identify the most impressive milestones in his career. For example, he was the sole pediatrician chosen to be the co-chair for the multi-center NIH Network and in a sole effort helped start a new division of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition at UCSD and Children's Hospital in San Diego.
Joel Lavine MD was also the vice-chairman of Pediatric Research at Columbia for five years and the vice-chairman of Pediatric Faculty and Fellow Development at UCSD for eight years. These years helped him steer these organizations towards better research goals and more active fundraising, including more robust training for pediatric professionals. In addition, his educational career has helped him transform both these and other organizations into more successful and well-funded organizations.
Further educational milestones include tenured positions as a full professor at UCSD and Columbia. His experience here and his research helped him become the most cited author at Columbia in Children's Health over the last two years. This research is continually cited from Research Gate and Google Scholar, the two most prominent online citation tracking authorities available. Furthermore, Dr. Joel Lavine was also named on ""Top Doctors,"" ""SuperDoctors,"" and ""Best Doctors"" lists in New York and San Diego multiple times, further spreading his career success to new areas.
Other awards worth mentioning include being the Presidential Plenary Speaker at the American Association for Study of Liver Diseases, the Director of Liver Research at both the Boston Children's Hospital and the highly esteemed Harvard Medical School, and being awarded a 15 million dollar gift from the Seidenberg Family for a new Outpatient GI/Hepatology Clinic for Columbia.
Of all these accomplishments, Joel Lavine MD is probably proudest to celebrate 40 years of happy marriage, his daughter placing in the top five in Latin Ballroom Rhythm and Smooth dance in Orlando, and the birth of his first granddaughter. Such personal successes make him happy after a long and continually successful career.",https://twitter.com/jl3553Columbia,http://linkedin.com/in/joel-lavine-943a0822,https://www.facebook.com/Joel-Lavine-MDPhD-101116669300944,"63",—,—,"—",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.7","2.3","7.9"

"Chad Price","Founder &amp; CEO","Mako Medical Laboratories","Raleigh, North Carolina, United States","285","Chad","Price","Male","Research Triangle, East Coast, Southern US","Driven by his strong faith and desire to help, Chad Price has had incredible success in startups. He has founded Mako Medical, co-founded Bride Genie and founded Element Services Group Mechanical LLC. He was also a part of starting Cary Reconstruction and is a board member for Trill A.I.
With no knowledge of the medical industry, Chad Price took things head-on and didn’t look back. Along with Jason Arant, he started Mako Laboratories LLC in 2014 to meet a real need for better customer service and increased transparency between labs and customers. His current labs processed over two million COVID-19 tests in 2020 alone with fast turnarounds and an easy-to-access patient portal for “real-time” results.
In 2018, he expanded his medical company to offer prescription connections with MakoRx. This allowed patients to compare multiple pharmacies to find the best pricing for their drugs. In 2020, he took this a step further with MakoRx loyalty that offered free or greatly reduced prescriptions at over 300 locations, supporting families that were struggling to pay monthly medical costs.
In 2019, his startup Bride Genie was launched, connecting engaged couples to vendors. This helps clarify industry pricing, expectations and criteria for easier matching.
In 2012, he founded Element Service Group Mechanical LLC to offer refrigeration and HVAC services to large companies. He landed contracts with a number of big names, including COSTCO, Whole Foods, Harris Teeter and several large biotech firms.
Chad Price continues to offer consulting services to companies that are facing mergers or major growth. His business experience offers insightful support for changing companies from simple structures to scalable operations.
He lives in the Raleigh-Burham, NC area and is active at his church. He also supports a number of local nonprofits, where he volunteers his time regularly.",https://twitter.com/chadmakomedical,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chad-price-b907182/,https://www.facebook.com/Chad-Price-106387988017921,"39",—,"1","Mako Medical Laboratories",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.5","-0.8","6.3"

"Dr. Kami Hoss","Co-Founder","The Super Dentists","San Diego, California, United States","287","Dr. Kami","Hoss","Male","Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US","Dr. Kami Hoss, DDS, MS has been applying his entrepreneurial drive coupled with his visionary leadership for the past 20 years to achieve remarkable revenue growth and business development in the dental and orthodontic arts. With the help of his wife and current business partner, Dr. Nazil Keri, the two founded The Super Dentists in San Diego and, using their skills and business acumen, were able to grow it into the largest pediatric dental and orthodontic practice in the San Diego area. 
Over the past twenty years, Kami Hoss and Nazil Keri have helped The Super Dentists grow from a single doctor working out of a single office to over 120 employees who serve more than 100,000 active patients all throughout the San Diego area and occupy 5 building throughout California. As CEO, Dr. Kami Hoss has taken it upon himself to manage the development, expansion, renovation, and daily building operation of each of his dental offices. Despite the economic downturn, the company has seen continual growth in income and profits each year, and now serves approximately one out of every seven people in the San Diego area. In terms of orthodontia, The Super Dentists holds the status of “Elite Provider” for all three systems of braces; worldwide, only 2% of orthodontists are given this distinction. 
Outside of the day-to-day dental work, The Super Dentists is recognized for its community involvement, especially The Super Dentists Academy and The Super Dentists Foundation. The Super Dentists Academy presented to over 30,000 local children in 2014 alone and continues to provide education classes for doctors and staff alike. Kami believes that, through educating children about their oral and dental health, we can give them all the tools they need to have a lifelong healthy smile. 
Kami Hoss has a passion for education and as a result, spearheads various annual events to continue providing scholarships - both academic and athletic - for schools throughout the year. Alongside his co-worker Edward Rey, Kami Hoss also founded the Howard Healthcare Academy, an accredited Dental Assisting School. He is also a member of several prestigious dental associations, including the American Association of Orthodontists, California Association of Orthodontists, World Federation of Orthodontists, and the American Dental Association, and Kami serves on the Eastlake Dentistry board of directors. 
Outside of dentistry, Kami Hoss has made a name for himself in the real estate and farming world. As he was growing his business back in 1997, he purchased a condo out of which he could grow his young dental practice and found he enjoyed the process very much. Kami immediately took to real estate development which inspired him to begin searching for lucrative real estate development opportunities elsewhere. It wasn’t long before Kami began locating and purchasing properties independent from his dental practice and the dental industry itself. 
Since 1997, Kami has acquired, developed, and managed more than 150,000 combined square feet of commercial real estate spread out over 3,000 acres in multiple states. He realized he had a knack for developing and now specializes in stabilizing properties that are underperforming and increases their value significantly, maximizing their return on investment (ROI) by using short-and long-term strategic planning, deal making, and business acumen to capitalize on the potential of each new property. 
As he built his real estate portfolio from initial land selection to full functionality, Kami learned the importance of building strong relationships with everyone you work with. Because of his immersive interest in real estate and his desire to learn the business from every angle, Kami worked on developing relationships with bankers, brokers, agents, vendors, construction superintendents, and tenants, all of whom assisted him not only in his real estate pursuits but also with gaining superior knowledge of real estate logistics, namely property development, renovation, zoning, finance, and construction. Because of his quickly developed acumen, Kami has learned how to negotiate leasing, construction, and land purchasing agreements and has successfully developed and managed commercial property that was able to double its value in just two to three years. 
In addition to acquiring high-potential properties which he turns into fully-utilized commercial space, Kami also works in the agricultural sector acquiring and developing raw farmland into lucrative nut orchards — primarily pistachios. He is a native of Iran which controls 50% of the world’s pistachio exports and is himself a third generation pistachio farmer which sparked his love for the crop. Kami oversees a small, devoted management team who assist him in finding new opportunities and building a better, greener future for the next generation. Kami is proud of his ability to pursue initiatives that are environmentally friendly through planting the resources that we all need to thrive. 
Kami Hoss was trained to be a Certified Commercial Investment Member, and belongs to several organizations including the International Council of Shopping Centers, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association, and the American Pistachio Growers. 
Outside of his work with dentistry and farming, Kami Hoss has deep love for music. He is a lifelong musician whose skills and diverse taste have roots in his childhood love for pianos and keyboards. Having grown up in Iran, Kami’s musical production is indicative of his genre-bending, culture-crossing internationally inspired taste in music. He was always a lover of Persian music and art for how they remind him of his home country and released a Persian music album internationally at age 19 through a Los Angeles record label.
Kami has since fine-tuned his hobby to help bolster his career in dentistry as he focuses on creating music through recording, sampling, and arranging digital media, specifically writing music for The Super Dentists. He wrote original songs for The Super Dentist Commercials and short movies, believing music to be the most powerful teaching tool, especially in terms of children. Kami also loves to spend his time playing his beloved 100th-anniversary-edition Yamaha piano.",https://www.twitter.com/kamihoss,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kami-hoss-70349059,https://www.facebook.com/Dr-Kami-Hoss-820066528357004/,"390","University of California, Los Angeles","3","The Super Dentists",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","1.8","-0.4","-1.4"

"Mike Bjorkman","—",—,"Santa Clarita, California, United States","346","Mike","Bjorkman","Male","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US","Mike Bjorkman is a well-known realtor, investor and philanthropist in California's Santa Clarita and Placerita Canyon region. A native of the area, he not only watched his small-town community grow up around him, but also took an active part in guiding the city's future as a real estate agent for over thirty years. Known for his intelligence, loyalty to the region and caring for the community, he exemplifies the best that the region has to offer.
As a driving force in the once-small town, Bjorkman has a solid understanding of the community he grew up in, including its people, its streets and its northern Los Angeles heart. His consistent service to the community with his larger-than-life personality at charity events, service as a board member at local non-profits and his role as a volunteer and party host for these groups shows his dedication to community and those in need within it.
Mike Bjorkman: Extreme Real Estate Success
Entering the real estate market in 1991, Mike Bjorkman immediately rose to the challenges provided by Re/Max and Keller Williams on a national basis. He quickly grew into many awards as a top-ranking agent, making Re/Max' Top 1% in the Nation list in his first year in the industry, remaining there throughout his career. He's also received Re/Max' Lifetime Achievement Award due to his skill as a real estate agent and his dedication to his community. He exemplified the very best offered by these two agencies by promoting the exceptional community he grew up in.
“In real estate, we’re constantly talking about Santa Clarita’s great sense of community, top-notch schools and perfect atmosphere to raise a family,” Mike Bjorkman stated during an interview. “But honestly, I couldn’t do this job if I didn’t truly believe it. When I tell you Santa Clarita is the best place to live in the world — I mean it. This city has given me and my family so much; it’s my duty to help the next generation of families get just as much from this community as I have.”
Expanding to New Horizons
He oversaw 300 HomeSmart agents that were located across five regional offices, covering the Santa Clarita, San Fernando, Conejo and Antelope Valleys, including Northridge. With over 4,500 transactions under his belt, he also managed over 350 residential properties in the region. He also runs a sister company, California Leasing. His agents represent light-hearted friendships who enjoy their role in the company while remaining completely serious with every transaction, delivering a superior customer experience time and again.
However, it wasn't quite enough. After spending an exceptional 25 years in the industry in Santa Clarita and being a top agent in the agency he moved to afterwards, Mike Bjorkman had a bigger vision for the city. He started working on his own, demanding the very best from both himself and from those that he surrounded himself with. He founded Team Bjorkman to create a real estate agency that was synonymous with outstanding excellence, customer service and community spirit.
The agents use their knowledge of the Santa Clarita area to leverage some of the best marketing education available in the business. With a combination of family-run intimacy and strength in numbers, the team is dedicated to making sure each client is treated like the only one in the world. With a team of eight agents or more, who are working in the background, using the best of their collective skills to ensure a seamless customer experience. “We do what other agents can’t, won’t or don’t to complete your transaction faster and with more money in your pocket,” Mike Bjorkman stated. “And we do it because we care.”
Philanthropist, Investor, Author, Speaker and Trainer
Following the examples of so many other successful businessmen, Mike Bjorkman put his money to work for him, learning much more about investments in the process while training people in crypto and day trading investment. By sticking to what he has already learned and understood, he is focused on real estate and property management investment, along with the best ways to sell or rent starter homes. This has made him much sought after as a philanthropist in the region, and his dedication to community service shines in this area.
But with so much success in the market, he's also realized a strong demand as an author, speaker and trainer at real estate events across the country. Because of his extensive experience in the industry, he felt driven to pass what he has learned onto the next generation of real estate agents. He offers extensive training opportunities for agents of all ages and experiences, freely sharing his knowledge while delivering dedicated coaching services for those who wish to expand their careers.
Bjorkman feels that there is nothing more important in life than taking care of the people he has promised to serve, whether at home, in the office or in the field. A promise from him to take care of you ensures you've got everything you need, with nothing more you could reasonably ask for.",https://twitter.com/mikebjorkman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikebjorkmansells,https://www.facebook.com/MikeBjorkmanPage/,"36",—,—,"Team Bjorkman",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.4","9.7","9.5"

Dono da característica empreendedora, Edgard Corona é um dos principais nomes do segmento fitness no Brasil.
Formado em Engenharia Química pela Fundação Armando Álvares Penteado (FAAP), entre 1974 e 1979, o CEO do grupo Bio Ritmo e Smart Fit já empreendia na faculdade, quando teve um laboratório de análises de materiais e, em seguida, uma confecção com lojas próprias. 
Por volta de 1996, Edgard resolveu sair da empresa da família e iniciou um novo negócio: essa seria a primeira academia Bio Ritmo, em Santo Amaro. Acidentado em uma prática de esqui, precisava realizar sessões de fisioterapia o dia inteiro, e nada melhor do que as fazer em sua própria academia. Decidiu se dedicar integralmente a este negócio, investindo tempo e observando atentamente os erros e acertos feitos até então. Assim, fundava a Bio Ritmo.
O objetivo do empresário era o de inovar e implantar um novo modelo de gestão de negócios do segmento esportivo. Enfrentando erros, neste primeiro momento a academia não conseguiu se desenvolver. Contudo, isso não desanimou Corona. Sempre buscando aprender com outras experiências, o executivo realizou o processo de “benchmark” e procurou reunir informações que o ajudassem a direcionar adequadamente aquilo que ele procurava alcançar. 
Com isso, abriu uma filial da academia Bio Ritmo na Avenida Paulista, visando criar um novo tipo de experiência e alcançar aqueles que tinham pouco tempo para a prática esportiva. A iniciativa deu certo e, cada vez mais, começou a ganhar destaque no segmento, com novas unidades sendo abertas. 
Mesmo com a empresa crescendo, Edgard não se deteve, começou a frequentar congressos do setor fora do país, o que fomentou a troca de experiências com gestores da área e a ideia de elaboração de um novo modelo de empresa para o setor. 
Então, em 2008, foi fundada a Smart Fit, um novo modelo de academia. A Bio Ritmo agora se tornava um grupo. O espírito empreendedor do gestor implementou novas alterações no negócio que se tornava uma referência na América Latina. 
Não por acaso, hoje, Edgard Corona é considerado um dos maiores precursores da gestão de negócios de prática esportiva, se posicionando entre os maiores empresários da América Latina por conta de sua atuação como CEO do grupo. 
Recentemente, a Smart Fit, seguindo com foco no propósito de democratizar o fitness de alto padrão, deu mais um passo importante: a abertura de capital para o mercado de investimentos na Bolsa de Valores do Brasil.
Os recursos captados pela Oferta Primária do Grupo Smart Fit terão como destino a continuidade do plano de crescimento, principalmente no cenário pós-pandemia, com possíveis aquisições estratégicas e investimentos em iniciativas para o desenvolvimento e fortalecimento da companhia de forma escalável, nos 13 países da América Latina onde a empresa possui filiais.",—,https://www.linkedin.com/in/edgard-corona-5b25164/,—,"45","Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado","3","Bio Ritmo, Bio Ritmo, Smart Fit, Smartfit Escola de Ginastica e Danca","3","3",—,—,—,—,—,"—","-0.1","-0.1","-1.8"

While building TINCO, I started an advisory business called Satya Management to serve start-ups in the consumer, media &amp; entertainment, and wellness industries.
Through a client, I fell in love with the live events industry and decided to start my 2nd company, 90sFest. 90sFest was a live events platform catered to millennials that pioneered the convergence of experiential marketing with mass social media distribution. We sold 90sFest to Scopus Media in 2017.
It was at this time that I was hired to try to salvage the now infamous Fyre Festival. Many who saw the Emmy-nominated Netflix documentary, Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, have called me the “voice of reason.”
After Fyre, I saw that my bitcoin investment returned 20x my principal and began deep research on the cryptocurrency industry. I later became Principal at a blockchain-focused venture fund called Wave Financial.
I left Wave Financial in 2019 to strike out on my own and continue to advise, coach, and invest in leading entrepreneurs.
I once again fell in love with an industry – sustainable agriculture – and now lead business development at Steward.",https://twitter.com/WarcMeinstein,https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-weinstein-59a3387/,https://www.facebook.com/warcmeinstein,"3","Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania","1","Mechanism Capital, Mellow Mushroom","10","11","4","1",—,—,—,—,"-0.8","-1.4","-1.5"

The company also works to create business opportunities that can help people find professional fulfillment through company partnerships.
The CEO attended Pace University in Pleasantville, NY where he received his formal education in Management Information Systems and Biology.

In his own work, the future CEO created novel techniques for synthesizing oxygen and hydrogen, designed a bladeless turbine generator, and worked on a combustion rocket engine.
David Schmidt created LifeWave after working to create methods that could help raise energy levels without resorting to potentially harmful drugs. His solution to this problem was the creation of his patented phototherapy patches, which now form the foundation of his company’s offerings. The patches work through topical application on a user’s skin where they can reflect specific wavelengths of light back into the body. This reflected light then initiates powerful changes to the body at the cellular level, creating the health and wellness benefits for which LifeWave has become known.",—,https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-schmidt-a4b24b4,—,"30","Pace University","2","LifeWave Health",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","0.5","4.4","4.2"

Dennis Haggerty has humble beginnings. He was the first in his family to graduate from college, despite growing up in a rural area. He moved to Chicago to pursue his professional dreams after graduating from Virginia Tech with a degree in accounting. Haggerty saw this Midwest city as an opportunity. He saw this business capital as a place where the American dream could be realized through hard work.
Dennis Haggerty is pursuing a number of professional objectives, including pharmacogenomics testing. This branch of medicine investigates how the body breaks down various medications. The metabolic process is critical in protecting patients from dangerous side effects, especially when it comes to genetics. It is especially beneficial for seniors, who may have comorbidities or conditions that cause adverse reactions. Haggerty is an innovator who is always looking for his next opportunity. He's built a degree of adaptability into his pursuits, so he's always prepared for what's ahead.
Professional Experience
Dennis Haggerty began his career at ARC Reprographics, where he quickly learned the financial side of the business. His accounting degree certainly helped, but Haggarty was also an expert at comprehending more than just numbers. His dedication and commitment earned him the title of Chief Financial Officer (CFO). He then advanced his career by joining AL Media, where he kept his CFO title while also gaining the title of Media Director.
Haggerty, one of the country's top political media firms, oversaw campaigns worth more than $1 billion. Senators, presidents, and representatives all relied on him to reach out to their target voters. Dennis was an expert at picking up on the nuances of various voter bases and how they changed over time. He made certain that every new strategy incorporated the fundamentals of these shifts, ensuring that each ad was as effective as possible.
Dennis Haggerty discovered that he wanted more from his career as he spent time learning the ins and outs of corporate and political America. In 2007, he made the decision to start his own business. The company, dubbed @Media, provided clients with integrated marketing services in order for them to increase their revenue and influence. Haggerty grew his company from one man to a full team, and people quickly recognized him for his tireless efforts to complete tasks.
Professional Qualifications and Experience
Haggerty Jr. has long been known for his unwavering work ethic and knack for industry forecasting. This instinct is what propelled him to the top of the advertising world. Politicians and businesses must consider not only how their voters and customers make decisions today, but also what kinds of cultural changes will emerge in the future.
When Haggerty became his own boss, he understood how branding and repetition would appeal to various demographics. (Just because two people had comparable incomes and lived on the same street did not mean they would respond to the same message on the same platform.) He had to be aware of when and why people tuned out information. He also needed to know what would get them to pay attention again. This would prove to be the turning point in his career. He not only had a natural talent in this area, but he also had the fortitude to return to a problem until he figured out the solution for himself.
Haggerty has risen through the ranks of his previous employers, as well as any industry he seeks to conquer. He was never afraid to try new things throughout his career. He had very little experience in the automotive industry when he started Car Dealer Benefits. As that venture grew, he decided that healthcare was the next industry he wanted to dominate.
This would prove to be a profitable decision for his portfolio, as his focus on genetic testing was the key to building relationships in the telemedicine world. While he couldn't predict the pandemic, he could see how technology was progressing in healthcare. When many people still had difficulty accessing services or prescriptions, Dennis Haggerty Jr. recognized that virtual appointments would be critical to leveling the playing field for patients of all backgrounds.
Dennis' healthcare company would go national once COVID-19 took over. Because of his rapid growth and success, Haggarty needed to scale his services. Fortunately, he had prior knowledge of what to do when your company is in high demand. As a former CFO, he understood how to manage his revenue so that it lasted. As a former CEO, he understood how to collaborate with others in order to meet the expectations of his customers. Dennis Haggerty Jr. not only remained calm and level-headed throughout every career turn, but he also thrived in the face of adversity.
Personal Experiences and Philanthropy
Dennis Haggerty enjoys working, but he also understands the importance of balance. He allowed his personal life to have a greater influence on his career after becoming a father. He had foundational beliefs that would drive his daily routines, just as he did in his first few roles.
He began with a simple premise: those who have been given much have an obligation to give back. Haggerty realized that people expected him to share his wealth, and he expected himself to do the same. He didn't take long before he was donating both his time and money to causes he supported. This included donations to shelters that encouraged adoption rather than euthanasia. He also seeks ways to assist ordinary people, as he understands what it is like to begin with very little.",https://twitter.com/dennishaggerty0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennishaggerty/,—,"24","Virginia Tech","1","—",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","7.1","8.4","10"

"Frank Zweegers","—",—,"The Netherlands, Europe","761","Frank","Zweegers","Male","European Union (EU)","Frank Zweegers is the founder of ZBG, a holding company with extensive interests in real estate development &amp; investment, agriculture and technology. He was born in the south of the Netherlands to a family of entrepreneurs with a strong track-record in the farming industry.
After high school, Frank Zweegers began to take an interest in investing. Not bound by convention or any preconceived sectoral bias, from his first investment onwards, Frank has always invested in people. He believes in fostering an ownership mindset in the executives of the entities within his portfolio and investing in the businesses to deliver sustainable value over an extremely long-time horizon, not only financially, but also in a material way.
Due to this innovative approach, ZBG’s portfolio has varied over the years. In more recent times, Frank Zweegers’ portfolio has coalesced around the three business areas of real estate development &amp; investment, agriculture and technology. In each area, ZBG’s businesses aim to use natural elements of the earth to improve the lives of people. 
Frank Zweegers’ grandfather, Piet Zweegers Sr, founded his own company “PZ” in 1937, manufacturing a range of threshers and mills, advanced equipment for that day and age. Following this tradition, Piet’s four sons Piet Jr., Andre, Tony and Jan, continued the family’s innovative track-record by inventing the cyclomower in 1964, an agricultural grass mower which is still in use today. An interest in agriculture and the urge to make a positive contribution to the production of value from the ground is clearly in Frank’s blood. With a growing world population, Frank Zweegers understands it is of the utmost importance to help farmers optimize their productivity and efficiency. Precision farming focuses on developing new technologies, equipment and methods to achieve exactly that. It is therefore an important area for ZBG to invest.
Similarly, ZBG has invested in an innovative technology company that speeds up the development and approval of innovative medical devices and machinery that help patients be diagnosed in a smoother, quicker and less painful way and improves therapies that cure diseases and other health issues.
Frank Zweegers also invests in real estate development. The growth in popularity of urban living especially in key international cities, is a main driver for his real estate projects. The aim is to provide millennials access to the city lifestyle, which is an increasing challenge due to the shortage of quality housing and office space in many markets. Developing new, more sustainable real estate projects is helping to solve this societal problem.
With these investment focus areas ZBG aims to have a lasting positive effect on the future of this earth and the people on it.",—,—,—,—,—,—,"—",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","0.8","4.8","8.5"

"Don Ressler","Co-founder &amp; CEO","Fabletics","Los Angeles, California, United States","828","Don","Ressler","Male","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US","Don Ressler is the entrepreneur behind a series of successful start-ups, including Intelligent Beauty and its subsidiaries. After his first start-up, FitnessHeaven.com, was purchased by Intermix Media in 2001, Ressler teamed-up with then 19-year-old Intermix COO Adam Goldenberg to form Alena Media. The ecommerce and performance advertising division generated hundreds of millions in revenue and was Intermix’s only profit center. When Intermix was acquired by News Corp in 2005, Ressler and Goldenberg found themselves watching the profitable, successful ecommerce business they had built be ignored by the media conglomerate. Frustrated and not bound to the new company, the partners left to explore new opportunities.
Knowing that they had the skills to excel in the growing field of online performance advertising, the Ressler and Goldenberg decided to create a brand building enterprise they could execute autonomously. Gathering a group of former Alena team members, the co-founders held a brainstorming session in Goldenberg’s living room. Two-weeks later, Brand Ideas, later to become Intelligent Beauty, was born.
The direct-to-consumer brand building business’s first creation was DERMSTORE, an online skincare and cosmetics marketplace. Two years later, they launched weight-loss system SENSA, bringing in Dr. Alan Hirsch for product development and Intermix founder Brett Brewer as CEO. Though Intelligent Beauty doesn’t release its financial results, both SENSA and DERMSTORE are said to be highly profitable. After bootstrapping most of their funding for the first two years, the company accepted $43 million in funding from Technology Crossover Ventures in 2008.
In 2010, Intelligent Beauty launched a third company, subscription ecommerce fashion retailer JustFab. In 2011, JustFab received $33 million in funding from Matrix Partners. Kimora Lee Simmons joined the company as President and Creative Director in September of that year, and by December they had reached 4 million members. After announcing it had crossed the six million member mark in April 2012, the co-founders raised a second round of funding, securing $76 million from Rho Ventures, Matrix Partners, Crossover Ventures, and parent-company Intelligent Beauty that June.
Riding on the momentum of these successful first two years, JustFab started seeking opportunities to expand into new markets. Recognizing that many of their existing customers were parents, JustFab purchased children’s fashion subscription service FabKids on Jan 18, 2013. On May 23, 2013, JustFab acquired European fashion ecommerce site The Fab Shoes. The addition of The Fab Shoes brought with it 500,000 member in France and Spain, adding to the 1.5 million-strong European membership JustFab had built in Germany and the UK. By the end of 2013, JustFab had 3 million members throughout Europe. On October 1, 2013, after completing a $40 million Series C funding round, JustFab launched Fabletics, an athletic wear site developed in collaboration with Kate Hudson. They company also acquired rival shoe subscription service ShoeDazzle, bringing it into the JustFab family in August 2013. Finally, in addition to expanding services to include kids’ wear, athletic wear, and European markets, JustFab took their services offline, opening their flagship store in September 2013.
In August 2014, JustFab closed an $85 million round of funding led by Passport Special Opportunity Fund, and including existing investors Shining Capital, Matrix Partners, and Technology Crossover Ventures. The round brought the company’s total capitalization to $250 million.",—,—,—,"24",—,"3","Fabletics, Intelligent Beauty, TechStyle Fashion Group","1","2",—,—,"1",—,—,"—","-0.6","-2","2.8"

All seven siblings of my mother had cancer, my grandmothers and grandfathers on both sides died of cancer! Even my father and my stepfather died of cancer.
My own mother was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, Liver Cirrhosis and terminal Liver Cancer with the prognosis of 6 month to live. I am happy to say that she is still alive and healthy today. 
My sister had cervical cancer which she completely overcame and remains cancer free for over 20 years now.
 I know more about cancer and the effects of cancer on the loved ones of the cancer patients than anybody will ever know. No one has even 1% of the knowledge about the horror of cancer and its mental and emotional impact on the cancer patients and his or her loved ones, in his own family as I have. No one has ever suffered the pain of being afraid for 24 hours a day that his mother could die at any moment for over 9 years, every single day!
 I have been there. I have helped my own mother and sister to fight the cancer successfully and it never came back. I have made a promise to God and stated: ""Dear God if you help me to cure my mom, I will spend the rest of my life to help other patents and their children not to have to go through what I and my mother went though."" Today with my educational word on TV, Radio, Stage and my books I am keeping my promise to God.",—,—,—,"1",—,—,"—",—,—,—,—,—,—,—,"—","1.2","1","4.5"

Some conditions are too complex for the minimally invasive surgery option. In the case of severe deformities or extensive damage, “open” surgery may be required. Generally, this should be a last resort, after other treatments, such as physical therapy, braces, and even minimally invasive surgery, have been unsuccessful at relieving pain or restoring function. Some conditions that may require complex spinal reconstruction are: Spinal tumors, Spinal deformities, Scoliosis, Degenerative disc disease.
The open nature of this type of surgery means there is more variability and more risk of complications during surgery. As such, a skilled surgeon with much experience is the best choice.
