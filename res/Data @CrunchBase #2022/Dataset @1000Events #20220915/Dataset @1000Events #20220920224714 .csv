The evolution of cloud computing and artificial intelligence are growing in parallel, and the complexity of the cloud is driving the need for AI. In addition, the complexity of AI is also creating the need for it to work better in the cloud environment with efficiency, transparency and control.
Organizations are taking a more data-driven approach, where artificial intelligence can be used to detect and proactively provide alerts on weaknesses and vulnerabilities both that are being exploited right now, or that might be exploited in the future. This is being done by analyzing data coming in and out of protected endpoints, both detecting threats based on known behavior, and spotting yet known threats based on predictive analytics. In this session we will be examining a use case for AI in action to prevent potential unauthorized access and the benefits of AI for cloud security services that include:
• Identification of threats that would otherwise go undetected.
• Automatization of the process of responding to threats.
• Improvement of the efficiency of security operations.
• Ability to reduce the cost of security operations.

Data science is transforming business and generating new value across the organization. Data science still often requires dedicated technology and sophisticated teams to execute successfully. As departments work to address today's wide range of competitive, regulatory, and operational challenges, it is easy to overlook a critical issue that many of their most complex challenges have in common: nearly all of them either are rooted in or exacerbated by ML tooling, ML Model governance issues (Bias and fairness), and training, including shortcomings in data access, data quality, or both. Data Science center of excellence (CoE) can be a centralized group that centers on a discipline's vision, governance, technique, and framework. This is especially helpful for data science because of the specialty abilities and innovation the discipline requires. Data Science center of excellence (CoE) can improve efficiency and stability in maintaining and delivering business-critical data improved decision-making through fairness and unbiased models with adequate compliance and regulatory needs.

Artificial intelligence and advanced data projects are gaining rapid traction. However, with all this interest and hype in AI, only a small percentage of AI projects are actually seeing success. Why are so many AI projects failing when they don’t need to? With all the resources, great technology, and skilled talent put towards building AI projects, we shouldn’t be seeing so much AI project failure, but up to 80% of AI projects are not being completed successfully or achieving critical success measures. Clearly it’s not a technology or people problem, so what could be the main issues holding back AI project success?
Leveraging experience with thousands of AI projects and experience through best-practices approaches to AI, Cognilytica shares in this webinar the most common reasons for AI project failures and the insights to be learned from those failures. In this webinar we will discuss common reasons we see AI projects fail, the risk of overpromising and underdelivering on AI capabilities, methodologies and processes that can guarantee a higher rate of success, and how to avoid the common traps and pitfalls that usually beset AI projects.

Far too often, agencies, organizations, and consulting firms are running data and AI projects without taking the right steps to ensure their success. Agile and iterative approaches have become adopted best practices for application development projects, but why don’t we have something similar when it comes to advanced analytics, big data, and AI projects? Without using best-practices approaches that standardize steps for data preparation, data identification, and data protection, it’s hard to achieve the success you’re expecting, wasting money and resources, leading to failure.
This session will walk through the Cognitive Project Management for AI (CPMAI) methodology to provide the foundation needed for project success, especially as you incorporate advanced analytics and AI projects. The CPMAI methodology is the established best practice for AI &amp; ML projects, and increasingly will be demanded by organizations and agencies that plan to develop, procure, and deliver AI and advanced analytics projects. This session will provide real world examples of how CPMAI methodology allows individuals to gain the skills needed for AI project success.

Over seven days, Hekka will be the main outfit sponsor of Uplive's livestreaming audition show for the Japanese audience, following a highly successful tie-up during New York Fashion Week. This year’s event will celebrate the return of travel and vacation breaks, featuring Hekka's new swimwear capsule collection, ""Style de Vie"", a 30-piece capsule collection of swimwear. 
Alongside its partner brand, Uplive, the leading global live video platform launched by Asia Innovations Group (AIG), the event will stage Japan's most famous Uplive hosts that will be featuring Hekka outfits, in its effort to promote both brands to the Japanese audience, as the Japan Swim Week becomes the focal point of the fashion world. 
It marks the second time Hekka and Uplive have collaborated this year following the success of NYFW 2022. Utilising Hekka’s unique “real time fashion” platform and Uplive's global reach, the brand expects to greatly increase awareness and user take up. It is projected that at least 10,000 media impressions across social channels for Hekka and Uplive will be generated, creating quality publicity that will continue to grow the innovative cooperation between the sister companies. The innovation in cooperation illustrates their parent group, AIG’s mission “to enrich people's lives worldwide through innovative and enjoyable live social products, which foster meaningful human connection”.
For Hekka, the inclusiveness to celebrate style for every woman, is core to the collection, whilst continuing to showcase some of the hottest looks across affordable designer swimwear. The ""Style de Vie"" range is a 30-piece lifestyle capsule collection of swimwear, apparel and accessories handpicked and inspired by modern trends, where 'be comfortable with your own style' is the goal and inspires owners every time they wear a piece from the collection. Included in the collection will be a range of the most popular selling bikinis and one pieces, as well as patterned and two-tone styles that will meet the runway for the very first time. 
“The collection we are bringing to Japan Swim Week this year is just a snapshot of what Hekka have to offer. We want to enable all our customers to be their true self and unleash an inner confidence inside of them” said Laure-Cecile Lafond-Fenonjoie, CMO of Hekka. “Our choice of clothing can activate a sense of amazingness within us, and through our ranges of swimwear and resort wear, we want everyone to bask in the distinct energy that fashion can provide.”

A problem can be solved or a question answered in many ways, but some ways may be better than others. The question of how hard a problem is to solve is something that scientists, researchers, computer scientists, governments and businesses have all thought about for a long time. These different groups work in different domains and are concerned with different questions of interest but an underlying need to categorize questions into categories is a need that unites them all. You may have a problem you want to solve, like sorting a list from highest to lowest or understanding which applications for a program will take the longest to adjudicate. Some of the questions (especially in the computational arena) don’t necessarily have a human interaction or social complexity aspect to them. Other questions (like those primarily asked in business and governmental contexts) are inescapably tied to issues around human behavior and the added complexity that it brings. Using advanced analytics we can begin to understand these problems better and position ourselves in ways that lead to better outcomes. 
Join this webinar to learn how Guidehouse achieves the best performance possible given these complicated problems using Case Complexity Analysis. Be sure to stick around for Q&amp;A with Harold!

Far too often, agencies, organizations, and consulting firms are running data and AI projects without taking the right steps to ensure their success. Agile and iterative approaches have become adopted best practices for application development projects, but why don’t we have something similar when it comes to advanced analytics, big data, and AI projects? Without using best-practices approaches that standardize steps for data preparation, data identification, and data protection, it’s hard to achieve the success you’re expecting, wasting money and resources, leading to failure.
This session will walk through the Cognitive Project Management for AI (CPMAI) methodology to provide the foundation needed for project success, especially as you incorporate advanced analytics and AI projects. The CPMAI methodology is the established best practice for AI &amp; ML projects, and increasingly will be demanded by organizations and agencies that plan to develop, procure, and deliver AI and advanced analytics projects. This session will provide real world examples of how CPMAI methodology allows individuals to gain the skills needed for AI project success.

Over four days, Hekka will join more than 200 leading brands to showcase new designs and debut 2023 collections during the world's largest swimwear and beach fashion event. This year's event will celebrate the return of travel and vacation breaks, moving forward from the covid-19 era, as designers from over 70 countries attend the show. Meanwhile, pioneering technologies will be blended with fashion including a virtual swimwear Metaverse. Over 20,000 industry stakeholders including retail platforms, media, designers, bloggers and celebrities will descend on iconic locations such as Miami South Beach attending a week full of runway shows, VIP parties, and exclusive events. Miami Swim Week is expected to reach more than 1.6 billion impressions across social channels. 
On heel of Hekka's stellar debut at New York Fashion Week earlier this year, Hekka will launch at Miami Swim Week 2022 ""Style de Vie"", a 30-piece capsule collection of swimwear for the first time. Alongside its partner brand, Uplive, the leading global live video platform launched by Asia Innovations Group (AIG), they will extend Hekka's designs and Uplive's social platform to new audiences, as Miami Swim Week becomes the focal point of the fashion world.
It marks the second time Hekka and Uplive have collaborated this year following the success of NYFW 2022. Utilising Hekka's unique ""real time fashion"" platform and Uplive's global reach, the brand expects to greatly increase awareness and user take up. It is projected that at least 2 million media impressions for Hekka and Uplive will be generated, creating quality publicity that will continue to grow the innovative cooperation between the sister companies.

But recently, sovereignty and cybersecurity have become two of the Commission’s objectives in a strategic context marked by the domination of the two digital superpowers, the United States and China. Yet Europe does not lack assets. It still lacked a unified and ambitious discourse, followed by effective action sustained over time. In March 2021, the European Commission showed the way by launching its “Digital Decade” programme. Cybersecurity has an essential place in this strategy. It is both its cornerstone and spearhead.
The operational response is based on an industrial foundation that guarantees strategic autonomy. After defining demanding standards for security and personal data protection, Europe must create the conditions for ecosystems to develop, whether in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, or semiconductors. The ways and means of cybersecurity call for a political stance. Europe must equip itself with the diplomatic tools that will enable it to “persuade”—if not “dissuade”—potential adversaries and to assert its interests and its vision of a sustainable digital world, centered on human beings and based on shared values.
After the time for reflection, the time for pragmatism and action has come! The many legislative projects (NIS2, cyber resilience, e-evidence, product security, DMA, DSA, semiconductors, etc.) will only bear fruit if they are accompanied by a rapid increase in capabilities (operational, technological, military, diplomatic, industrial, etc.) contributing to cyber security. But the first condition is the mobilisation of talents and skills. At a time when historical alliances are weakening or disintegrating, the question can be summed up as follows: “to be or not to be European”. Europe kicks off!
The FIC 2022 will be one of the events of the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union on digital security and trust issues.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software","Cyber Security, Software",—,—,—,—,—,198

Data Analytics is considered the fourth phase of industrialization. Not surprisingly, organizations are rushing to build up and accelerate their data science capabilities. While robustness of data, and availability of talent remain their primary concerns, one of the hidden failure modes is model maintenance. MIT Sloan Tech Review estimates that these costs can add up to several times the cost of model development over the lifecycle of the model. Yet majority of companies continue to underestimate both the costs and complexity associated with model maintenance. This results in poor ROI, but more importantly, model maintenance is a weight around the ankles of data science teams that results in reduced productivity and attrition.

The theory learned in vocational School can be directly applied in practice at the training company. The German chambers of industry and commerce (Migr8.in) support trainees and training companies throughout the term of the apprenticeship. Feel free to contact us.
Ausbildung in Germany
 
On the off chance that you just have an ""Abitur"" or the identical capability (12th pass), you'll focus on double-track professional preparation in Germany. Double track preparation includes both hypothetical and down-to-earth parts.
Let's speak about what's Ausbildung in Germany.
AUSBILDUNG could be a type of education or apprenticeship where a student attends school and works simultaneously. the student gains both theoretical and practical knowledge at the identical time. it's a profession-related education that is leading you towards a certain job. you'll be able to find Ausbildung for pretty much anything.
Duration of Ausbildung Program in Germany
Normally, the Ausbildung program goes on for 3-4 years, yet assuming your grades are great in light of your exhibition within the organization and professional preparation school, then this era will decrease. 
In any case, it's no huge effect, because the hour of three years may be decreased to 2.5 years, so it hardly matters.
The period typically relies upon different elements like which organization you're working for, which office you're relegated to, and from which professional preparation school you're examining.
In any case, there's something significant you gravely expect to be qualified for the Ausbildung program, which is capable of the High German.
Language Requirement For Ausbildung In Germany
You can apply for an apprenticeship in Germany if you're an overseas national and you have got German as your natural language. If you're not, you'll be able to still apply for this program. you simply must ensure you're fluent in the German language.
You also can apply for an Ausbildung if you have got no formal education but have an interest in technical fields. In almost every field of study, you'll apply for this program. It will be a dual education or education.
 
What Is vocational education In Germany?
Vocational training prepares you for an occupation or work that needs a special set of skills, like an artisan, tradesperson, technician, craftsman, or electrician. this may include classroom teaching, practical training, or a mixture of the 2. However, education takes place outside the formal education system to realize practical knowledge and frequently ends up in a vocational qualification certificate or diploma. you'll directly receive vocational education as an apprentice from an experienced employer irrespective of whether you have got a proper qualification or not.
Importance Of vocational education In Germany 
Following are some reasons for vocational education in Germany:-
Vocational training allows you to seek out a high-paying job or career quickly after completing the programme.
It helps you in improving your work efficiency and being more productive in your job.
Vocational training provides skilled and trained workers to the market and industry.
Vocational training provides employment opportunities in small cities and towns, thereby preventing the population from migrating to big cities.
After completing the vocational education, you may receive a certificate issued by an independent organization, proving that your skills and position are better than applicants without formal training.
What is new in education in Germany?
Germany offers a dual vocational education programme that has opportunities for on-the-job training and acquiring practical work experience. The duration of dual vocational education courses is around two to a few years, where you're given both theoretical and practical knowledge. A student is required to spend the initial few weeks with the training school to find out theoretical knowledge required for the work, after which the student is shipped to the assigned company for practical experience and practice. the opposite way of delivering the programme may be a day or two spent within the classroom of the participating training center and therefore the remaining days of the week on the work placement.
These are some following reasons why you must pursue vocational education in Germany instead of the other country.
Vocational training courses may be your ticket to a permanent career within the German job market. Approximately two-thirds of apprentices have found permanent positions within the company after completing vocational education. After completing the program, you may obtain an entire professional qualification from the institute and earn an honest income. every one of the advantages of working with an identical training company is that you simply already know your company, your work, and your colleagues, which can surely benefit you.

The Top Reasons for AI Project Failure - and What you can Do about it,2022-09-20,2022-09-20,—,—,September 2022 The Top Reasons for AI Project Failure - and What you can Do about it by Cognilytica,"Conference, Virtual, Webinar",—,https://www.cognilytica.com/CLNzAyMzZ8MTg,www.cognilytica.com/CLNzAyMzZ8MTg,"Artificial intelligence and advanced data projects are gaining rapid traction. However, with all this interest and hype in AI, only a small percentage of AI projects are actually seeing success. Why are so many AI projects failing when they don’t need to? With all the resources, great technology, and skilled talent put towards building AI projects, we shouldn’t be seeing so much AI project failure, but up to 80% of AI projects are not being completed successfully or achieving critical success measures. Clearly it’s not a technology or people problem, so what could be the main issues holding back AI project success?
Leveraging experience with thousands of AI projects and experience through best-practices approaches to AI, Cognilytica shares in this webinar the most common reasons for AI project failures and the insights to be learned from those failures. In this webinar we will discuss common reasons we see AI projects fail, the risk of overpromising and underdelivering on AI capabilities, methodologies and processes that can guarantee a higher rate of success, and how to avoid the common traps and pitfalls that usually beset AI projects.

A chess program, speech recognition, an algorithm to rapidly buy and sell financial products. These are straightforward applications of structured data problems. One of the chief difficulties is in getting understanding in the enterprise beyond these structured data cases, particularly in the domain of limited budgets. Once the “first generation AI” is implemented, successfully or not, the next step is more lateral movement – development of more standalone cases, rather than layering and refactoring to produce additional complexity, the neural nets and deep learning AI problem sets. Join this interactive session to learn some of the difficulties associated with implementing AI as well as the difficulties moving from “first generation” to “second generation” AI in order to achieve business process improvement by modifying data architecture to reflect how data is actually used.

However, figuring out what to automate, why to automate, and what return on investment (ROI) automation will provide can be tricky.

Far too often, agencies, organizations, and consulting firms are running data and AI projects without taking the right steps to ensure their success. Agile and iterative approaches have become adopted best practices for application development projects, but why don’t we have something similar when it comes to advanced analytics, big data, and AI projects? Without using best-practices approaches that standardize steps for data preparation, data identification, and data protection, it’s hard to achieve the success you’re expecting, wasting money and resources, leading to failure.
This session will walk through the Cognitive Project Management for AI (CPMAI) methodology to provide the foundation needed for project success, especially as you incorporate advanced analytics and AI projects. The CPMAI methodology is the established best practice for AI &amp; ML projects, and increasingly will be demanded by organizations and agencies that plan to develop, procure, and deliver AI and advanced analytics projects. This session will provide real world examples of how CPMAI methodology allows individuals to gain the skills needed for AI project success.

The future is bright, but Searchlight is looking to make it even brighter with topical areas that include quality of hire, future of work, the role and importance of data in supporting the employee lifecycle, DEIB, and advances in technology that create virtuous cycles of learning. We will look to have speakers, panels, podcasts, and networking sessions that bring a unique spark of insight that will lead to better outcomes, a more connected community, and can’t-miss moments. A community hub developed by People people for People people.
Successful companies know that good talent is a precious resource. But unfortunately, measuring talent efficiency – or how well we’re leveraging our talent – is still part art, part science. At a time when burnout is at an all-time high and headcount growth is at a low, HR and Talent expert Allison Pickens will join our Light After Dark Series to explore this topic and share her unique perspectives on talent efficiency. Is talent efficiency the secret to a company’s success? How can it be measured today? Join our panel as we dig into this topic from the perspective of founders, operators, and people and recruiting leaders. Questions and comments are welcome.
Join HR, Talent and Employer Brand professionals and leaders for Searchlight’s Light After Dark (LAD) as we shine a spotlight on key topics, trends and approaches that are shaping this space in 2022 and beyond.

The ABC (acronym for Asset Backed Crypto) Summit will serve as a business show for several start ups from the most diverse areas which have in common the fact that their activities are supported by assets (gold, silver, lithium,…) or added value projects.
Using this criteria, the organisation was able to scrutinise the type of companies and their business model if seeking crowdfunding through the issuance and sale of own cryptocurrencies - Initial Coin Offer (ICO).
Such pre-selection will certainly help investors to look with greater confidence at projects presented at the event, specially at a time when market volatility leads to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin - originated in the Blockchain and based on speculation - undergoing extreme price swings. 
Among the prominent public speakers who have confirmed their presence are Kevin O'Leary - ""Mr. Wonderful"" from the hugely successful US TV program «&nbsp;Shark Tank&nbsp;», Dragan Primorac, an internationally renowned and awarded physician and many others (Kenny Au, Eric Gu, David Teruzzi, Vladimir Nikitin,…).
Blockchain has the potential to become the next mainstream infrastructure for communication and commerce, for instance, and can introduce new freedoms while streamlining compliance and universal interoperability.
 
The ABC Summit will be held at the Estoril Casino's (Lisbon) “Salão Preto e Prata”, from May 16 to 17, 2018.

Comparing companies
Narrowing down products from a brand
Navigating to a website
Looking for directions to a store
Researching a CEO or company for investing
Reading product reviews
Leaving reviews
Looking for customer service information

Przed nami jak zwykle dwie prezentacje – w trakcie pierwszej z nich, Tomasz Surowiec opowie o “read modelach” i ich wykorzystaniu, zaletach oraz ewentualnych wadach. Druga prelekcja będzie natomiast poświęcona testowaniu API. Połączenie z bazą danych czy implementacja w pamięci? Które z podejść sprawdzi się lepiej? Po każdej prezentacji jak zwykle będziecie mogli zadawać pytania naszym uszanowankowym prelegentom. Widzimy się 28 września. Uszanowanko!
Program:
– Tomasz Surowiec, PHP Lead Developer – Jak skutecznie read model. Case study
Opowieść o tym, jak w projekcie legacy, który już ledwo dychał, udało się zaimplementować read model oparty na ElasticSearch (choć nie bez przeszkód i czasami pod prąd). Podczas prezentacji aplikacja legacy i walka o przyspieszenie zapytań posłuży jako punkt wyjścia do przeanalizowania konceptu “read modeli”. Po co wdrażamy je do aplikacji? Jakie są metody utrzymania ich w spójności? A w końcu – ich wady i zalety. W przypadku wspomnianej aplikacji zapytania które trwały około 8 minut udało się przyspieszyć do poniżej 1s (choć nie obyło się to bez potknięć). Zobacz jak!
– Krystian Żądło, PHP Developer – Testy API: połączenie z bazą danych czy implementacja w pamięci
Testy integracyjne wykonują realne żądania na API. Trzeba zatem zadbać o odpowiednie skonfigurowanie środowiska do testów. Kwestia danych to jedno z podstawowych zagadnień z którym należy sobie poradzić. Do tematu można podejść na kilka sposobów, ale sprowadzają się one do dwóch kategorii: baza danych albo implementacja w pamięci. Dowiedz się, które z nich sprawdzi się w twoim projekcie.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Software","Cloud Data Services, Developer APIs, Software, Web Development",1,—,—,—,—,269

At the same time, the sector must overcome the biggest challenge in its history. The COVID-19 pandemic brought international tourism to a near-complete standstill.
The sector must not only restart and recover, but it must also ensure future growth is more inclusive and responsible. Out of crisis can come opportunity. Clear, principled leadership will be required to realize tourism’s transformative potential.
Now is the time to build a better tourism:
FOR PEOPLE
Tourism can be a source of opportunity and empowerment. It must centre the needs of host communities and provide decent jobs for all, especially for youth, women and the most vulnerable groups in our societies. The tourism of the future must embrace local values, respect cultures and preserve and celebrate our unique and shared heritage, while at the same time adapting to digitalization and supporting new jobs skills.
The UNWTO Global Code of Ethics for Tourism, provides a framework against which tourism can develop and grow while always putting people first, while the UNWTO International Code for the Protection of Tourists makes clear the sector’s responsibilities to individuals, providing reassurance and restoring trust in travel.
FOR PLANET
Tourism must live up to its climate action responsibilities as a matter of urgency. All tourism stakeholders must assess and address tourism’s use of energy, land, water and food resources, as well as tourism-related carbón emissions. Now is the time to develop new models to reformulate and transform tourism and accelerate progress towards sustainability and net-zero growth, while providing innovative financing and the necessary investment infrastructure to make ambitious intentions a reality.
Measurement and disclosure of CO2 emissions in tourism also needs to be stepped up, accelerating decarbonisation advancing towards a sustainable tourism sector that advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while remaining profitable.
FOR PROSPERITY
Tourism is a major pillar of economic growth and wellbeing, one of the world’s leading employers, and a leading generator of opportunity and empowerment. The sector must commit to safeguarding businesses and livelihoods. Destinations and companies should be supported in becoming more competitive by diversifying and building greater resilience through skills development, innovation and digital transformation.","Education, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Sustainability, Travel and Tourism","Education, Information Technology, Marketing, Sustainability, Tourism",—,—,—,—,—,285

Keeping clients sticky is about much more than doing good work in your chosen discipline, it often hinges on the broader marketing strategy the business is working from and ensuring that the client has strong strategic foundations, with no legacy items holding their marketing, and the agency’s efforts, back.
The 9Boxes is a transparent, repeatable model for developing holistic marketing strategies for clients. The program covers key preparatory work including reviewing market position, undertaking customer insights research, mapping customer journeys and building the channel mix to complement those journeys. The 9Boxes also educates clients on strategic marketing and builds capability and skill within their team. We show agencies how to deliver strategy for clients to ensure they are adequately prepared for tactical implementation – allowing agencies to focus on what they do best, without anything holding them back. In addition to that, a strong revenue stream can be built from strategy – meaning you can stop giving it away.

This is most relevant now to the domain of web search, where, in recent years, users everywhere are gravitating more towards consuming visual media for a quick and concise view of information. With this being a global phenomenon, it’s important that we enable users to find the information they’re seeking and that’s contextually relevant to them given any language they choose to express themselves in. In this talk, we’ll chat about what are key considerations for international image/video search, where language agnostic vs. language specific aspects help, and how deep learning is leveraged, more specifically how both text and media embeddings with vector-based search are used, to find the best image/video content to delight users.

Cryptocurrency and NFTs have been a hot topic – and one that advisors with high net worth clients are looking for concrete guidance on. Many clients are heavily invested in the space, and are interested in creating and collecting NFTs. This has created a series of unique challenges from a tax, legal, and risk perspective. The slow roll-out of State and Federal legislation adds to the complexity.

They handle their clients’ complete picture: from their banking and bill pay, to insurance, cyber-security, business ventures, large purchases and investing.
“Over the past few years, having a few clients ‘dabbling’ in cryptocurrency has turned into a powerful set of tools for entertainers to generate revenue, and engage and grow their fan base. In many cases musicians generated more revenue from NFTs and investing in cryptocurrencies in the past two years than anything else,” says Matthew Hoffman, the founder of Trusted Advisor.

Online, it is absolutely vital that you start on the right foot by communicating with a brand message that makes commercial sense for your business. Avoid the temptation to ""go SEO"" or ""please Google"". 
Jason Davis will cover how you can build a solid online commercial strategy that drives more business through multiple channels (including your traditional offline channels)... Jason's focus will be your website because it is the front door of your business. 
Build an effective digital strategy by building from your own website homepage outwards. How? Jason will explain... including:
- SEO only works if you have a visually professional designed brand (images, graphics, copy).
- Professional services are not cheap, and digital marketing services at a discount are a bad idea (don't cut corners).
- Who has time to read? Headlines is what we pay attention to, pick yours carefully.
Tune in to this episode of Kalicube Tuesdays that promises to be incredibly insightful and helpful for every bricks and mortar company and local brand!

Web accessibility has a terrible reputation. It’s viewed as too costly, too time consuming to learn and blamed for wrecked artistic creativity. To convince companies to build inclusive websites and mobile apps, nothing beats ill informed, fear-based tactics like ADA lawsuit threats. In a competitive market, inclusivity is the deal breaker. Human experience design communicates a commitment to diversity, equality, accessibility, and service to others.
Service to others? Yes. This is what will make your company different from the competition. You invest in truly understanding not only who uses your website or web app, but how they do it. This is not the same thing as why. Profits, conversions, brand reputation. None of that is news. What is going to turn your ship around is exploring how to improve human experience on the web for millions of people who are excluded because we have ignored how they use it",Sales and Marketing,Digital Marketing,1,—,—,—,—,476

– Bartosz Drozd, Senior Node.js Developer – Jak utrzymać stado Lambd w ryzach – AWS, a w szczególności serverless computing, oferuje nam możliwość skalowania naszych systemów out-of-the-box. W większości przypadków jest to nam bardzo na rękę, ale… Co w sytuacji, gdy potrzebujemy z chirurgiczną precyzją kontrolować, ile aktualnie Lambd jest w użytku? Okazuje się, że nie jest to do końca taka prosta sprawa, gdyż AWS uporczywie robi wszystko, co może, aby wyskalować nasz system, niezależnie czy tego chcemy, czy nie. W tej prelekcji zaprezentuję możliwe sposoby rate limitingu naszych funkcji. Za przykład posłuży nam komunikacja z 3-rd party API, gdzie w większości przypadków jesteśmy ograniczeni ilością requestów, jakie możemy wykonać w jednostce czasu, żeby nie otrzymać 429-tki.
– Mikołaj Glistak, Node.js Developer – Firestore czyli ognista baza od giganta z Doliny Krzemowej – Podczas codziennej pracy każdy z nas korzysta z różnych baz danych,
Każda baza ma zachowania typowe dla siebie. Firestore to nierelacyjna baza od Google, która posiada wiele nietypowych funkcjonalności, wiele ciekawych rozwiązań. W tej prezentacji dowiemy się o paru fajnych zastosowań w Firestore i na co warto uważać przy implementacji tego rozwiązania.","Design, Software","Software, Web Design, Web Development",1,—,—,—,—,509

Yet, many of today’s AI assistants don’t use as much deep learning as we might think. While it’s common practice to apply machine learning to NLU (for intent detection), many implementations still use traditional rule-based or manual approaches that are tedious and time-consuming.
There are two areas of innovation in conversational AI where our SEO-minded approach can make a difference: training the agent with little manual effort and handling complex conversations by effectively re-using the content we already have on our websites.
During this webinar, Beatrice Gamba, SEO Strategist &amp; Senior Digital Project Manager at WordLift, and Teodora Petkova, Experienced Semantic Content Writer, will deep dive – with the help of Jason Barnard – into Knowledge Graph-based Conversational AI. More practically, we will see how we can re-use FAQ-based content and increase the ability of the chatbot to understand a wide variety of inputs from the users. How do we write this content, and what else can be done with content knowledge graphs.

The banking industry has rapidly adopted Machine Learning for various applications for predictive analytics and process automation. The adoption of AI/ML is very natural because of the nature of the business that is both data and process intensive. While the benefits of AI/ML are very compelling, they are also bringing new risks beyond the traditional financial risk. With their model risk management practice that has been maturing in the last 10 years, banks are ahead of other industries in managing the risk of AI/ML. One of the key aspects to manage the risk is model explainability. 
While the adoption of so called ExplainableAI, which is typically ‘black box’ machine learning models accompanied by post-hoc explainability tools, is becoming more common for low risk applications, the concern remains for high risk areas such as credit underwriting; thus large banks are typically more cautious in adopting the methodology. There are many recent developments on inherently interpretable, self-explanatory machine learning models without the problem of post-hoc explainers. The focus of my talk will cover applications of AI/ML, their risk management as well as the approach for designing inherently interpretable machine learning for high-risk applications.

Seaside Startup Summit is an outdoor campsite-based global forum that fosters intensive deal-making and immersive conversations about the hottest current topics in entrepreneurship since 2016. The event attracts leading angels, VCs, entrepreneurs and policy makers willing to join their peers in an intimate setting to think, act and transform their environment via entrepreneurship.
During the 4 years of operations, Seaside Startup Summit (SSS) has gathered around 15,000 participants from all over the globe. So far the Summit was held in UAE, India and Armenia by gathering local and regional influencers and policy-makers. In UAE the summit became a flagship event for the MENA region and has become a unique platform for cooperation. The commitment of over 1,000,000$ was gained during the event. In India SSS emerged to the unique Indian startup culture and gathered entrepreneurs operating in dozens of fields, giving them a chance of cross-communication. 
The next event will be in Armenia from 28th of July to 3rd of August at the shore of lake Sevan. The regional flagship startup event of this summer includes a week-long international level micro-acceleration program supplemented by a series of workshops for qualified startups, introductory sessions for aspiring entrepreneurs, and dialogues with inspiring leaders. All the participants are living in the tents during the whole event, which ensures the non-formal part of the event.
In 2019 the summit programme is divided into two parts, a booster acceleration programme with international experts and and a starter programme focusing on idea and pre-seed startups. The combination of both ensure a maximum of targeted capacity development effectiveness and the opportunity to use international experience as knowledge source for joint learning.
This is a specially designed programme dedicated to aspiring entrepreneurs and idea-stage startups – with a focus on Armenian teams and startups. The programme features a series of talks that examine and explain key building blocks of the Business Model Canvas. Sevan Startup Summit 2019 is accepting applications for up to 80 qualified teams. Participants will be divided into Industry Tracks and will have access to leading Mentors and Industry Experts during the one-on-one mentorship, dialogue Session, Pitch Practice and specially designed workshops. Mentors will work with teams to sharpen their business and pitching skills and prepare for the Industry Track Battles. At the end of the programme, teams within each Industry Track will pitch their ideas to an esteemed jury of investors and experts for a chance to go on to the Starter Big Battle. The top team from each Industry Track will receive US$1,500 in prizes. Up to 18 teams will be selected for the Semi-Finals out of which 6 teams will go on to participate in the Starter Big Battle Finals. The finalists will compete for US$10,000 in prizes for the top 3 teams and in-kind prizes worth up to US$20,000.
The booster programme is a specially designed intensive micro acceleration programme for qualifying start-ups that have developed an early prototype and secured some form of angel funding. Booster Track will be facilitated by expert Speakers and supported by Mentors, who will deliver a hands-on intensive acceleration experience. Top teams will be eligible for prize fund of US $10K and optional investments up to US $50K per-team from specially designed Booster funds.
The 4th Annual Sevan Startup Summit 2019 will be held on the shores of Lake Sevan, Armenia from 28nd July to 4th August 2019. For everyone interested in taking part in Sevan Startup Summit 2019 as a startup, investor or a speaker, the application is available here: https://www.sss.am/attend/.

A ponieważ, jak wiemy – kwiecień plecień to i my przygotowaliśmy niezły miszmasz i stawiamy na przedstawienie dwóch oblicz AWS. Aleksander Patschek opowie o tym jak przekształcić komponenty z Figmy do gotowej aplikacji przy pomocy AWS Amplify Studio, a Krzysztof Łoś skupi się w swojej prezentacji na implementacji procesów w chmurze przy użyciu AWS Step Functions. Po każdej prezentacji jak zwykle będziecie mogli zadawać pytania naszym uszanowankowym prelegentom. Widzimy się 27 kwietnia. 
Program:
– Aleksander Patschek, Senior Frontend Developer, Od Figmy do gotowej aplikacji bez linijki kodu – AWS Amplify Studio jest nowością od AWS’a, która pozwala połączyć komponenty Figma z bazą danych i wygenerować gotowy kod React. Czy to oznacza, że frontend deweloperzy przestaną być potrzebni? A może te narzędzie to tylko chwyt reklamowy? I czemu AWS zainteresował się narzędziami low-code/no-code. Na to wszystko Aleksander odpowie w swojej prezentacji. I pokaże na żywo jak przejść od Figmy do gotowej aplikacji.
– Krzysztof Łoś, Node.js Developer, Amazon Step Functions. Sposób na implementację procesów w chmurze – Zmęczony łańcuchowym (i wieloogniwowym) wywoływaniem AWS Lambd przez inne Lambdy? Śledzenie poszczególnych inwokacji od początkowej do końcowej Lambdy to droga przez mękę? I nawet AWS X-Ray tu nie wystarcza? Rozwiązaniem jest Amazon Step Function, czyli usługa AWS umożliwiająca łączenie poszczególnych kroków logicznych w proces, z jasnym dostępem do historii i szczegółów wywołań.","Design, Software","Software, Web Design, Web Development",1,—,—,—,—,648

Co może pójść nie tak? – Jednemu z naszych klientów pomagaliśmy niedawno zmigrować bazę użytkowników z systemu legacy do rozwijanej przez nas aplikacji. A ze względu na to, że była to aplikacja operująca na wrażliwych danych – bezpieczeństwo było dla nas najważniejsze! Co wzięliśmy pod uwagę? Co się nie udało? Na co trzeba uważać przy podobnych przedsięwzięciach? Wpadnijcie na prezentację – wszystkiego się dowiecie!
– Anna Kalemba, QA Team Manager, Co QA może i czego nie powinien się bać? – Jakie narzędzia pomagają w pracy QA? Co można zrobić, by jeszcze lepiej testować? Podczas prezentacji Ani dowiesz się kim tak naprawdę jest QA, jakie narzędzia może wykorzystywać w swojej pracy, a które z nich pozwalają na jeszcze lepsze podejście do testowania. Jak wpływa to na jeszcze lepszą jakość aplikacji?

Your time and energy help grow and maintain the vision and legacy of Brian J. Stephens, who started this rescue effort!
COVID vaccination required. Negative COVID test required.
Camp with us, enjoy the campfire at night with old and new friends, and hang out with the farm animal rescues.
We have a number of projects that we need help with in addition to the annual spring clean-up around the grounds.
We will be building two new campsites (camping is a big income generator for the rescue). Plus there is painting of the greenhouse and the tent decks that volunteers built last year.
There are donkey hooves to trim, wood debris to be gathered, poop to shovel, and more!
No experience is necessary.
Pack your mask, sleeping bag if you want to spend the night, and commune with the critters! Boots and gloves are recommended (it can be muddy and poopy).
Plus last fall volunteers planted 2,500 daffodils and they should be in bloom this weekend!
Can't join us? Donate to help the herd. It costs about $10 a day to feed the rescues.",—,—,2,—,—,—,—,775

However, these advances have brought several challenges including the interpretation of results from genetic tests, which are in part amplified by the lack of standards and knowledge on outcomes from such results. In parallel access to direct-to-consumer personal genetic testing has whetted the public’s appetite for genotyping and ancestry testing, which can result in increased enquires with clinicians in public healthcare systems. Sharing personal genomic data could result in access by third parties for unintended purposes. Finally the vast majority of genomes in public databases continue to be of European ancestries, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities.
The second Personal Genomes conference aims to address these issues.

Today, there are a host of mindfulness-based smartphone apps that are dedicated to improving the mental health and well-being of individuals. However, very few target Muslim populations who may be susceptible to poor mental health outcomes. This is largely due to Islamophobia, mental health stigma, and a lack of culturally competent and Islamically integrated mental health resources. Hence, the significance of Ruh, a mindfulness-based smartphone app based on the Islamic model of the Soul. It uses an inherently Islamic framework to integrate Islamic teachings with mindfulness techniques to promote positive mental health and well-being.

Google is leveraging MUM to improve the customer journey across Search, Lens, and other surfaces. MUM is multi-modal and encompasses vision, auditory, and language understanding simultaneously.
Traditional AI models handle one modality of information at a time. They can take in text, images, or speech — but typically not all three at once as MUM does. BERT, for example, can analyse the co-occurrences of words within the same page and understand their context. MUM takes it to an entirely new level by reading terms in any language and by combining, for example, information in visual and tactile modalities.

TUNE IN LIVE on Thursday, February 10th at 12:00pm ET to hear from Guy Hanson, Vice President of Customer Engagement at Validity, as he breaks down the current state of CRM Data Quality and outlines the strategies you need to stay ahead. You will learn: 
• What AI is (and is not), and the applications to the world of CRM 
• Why poor data is the top reason AI initiatives fail, and how to build a foundational data management process to get your CRM data in order

WHY CONNECTS?
The idea was conceived after 9/11, when logical debate became difficult. Issues require conversation, and the media was not facilitating it. Do not get us wrong; we are not interested in pointless confrontation, but rather considering alternative points of views on subjects that matter.
Throughout our travels, we come across amazing people. We are always searching the globe for insight and inspiration, and have had transformative experiences in places such as Singularity University. Our community should benefit from our new insights in more ways than just smarter investments.
At our inception in 2004, we created CONNECTS, a speaker series to help inspire and motivate each of you to become increasingly involved in social issues that affect our world.

Despite that search appears to be less responsive and less accurate than it was five years ago. There is a real reason for this and it is linked to human behavior and it affects both marketers and content creators.

David will then provide some of the solutions that can be applied here to ensure that from an SEO-point of view a business continues to be visible. To do so he will draw from the latest research in AI, Google’s implementation of MUM and BERT and the neuroscience that helps us better understand human behavior, especially when it comes to making purchase decisions.",Sales and Marketing,Digital Marketing,1,—,—,—,—,917
